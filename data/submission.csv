Nine students and three teachers were among the dead , State Interior Minister Heribert Rech said . It was Germany 's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002 . Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped , regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said . '' He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath , `` said regional police chief Erwin Hetger . '' I 've never seen anything like this in my life. `` After the attack , the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden , a town of 28,000 , Hinderer said , before police tracked him down . The teenager graduated from the school last year , police said . Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman opened fire . Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school , which was evacuated during the incident . The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire , shooting at random , police said . Police said the suspect was dressed in a black . About 1,000 children attend the school , located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart . In 2002 , 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers , a secretary , two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt .

2646,"""I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the `` it 's not in the Constitution `` position . This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state `` or `` collective `` right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` libertyÂ´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment .

In Casey , Scalia pointed out , `` But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments ; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text , as we did , for example , five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies , Lee v. Weisman , 505 U.S. 577 ( 1992 ) ; if , as I say , our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments , then a free and intelligent people 's attitude towards us can be expected to be ( ought to be ) quite different . The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better .

3347,"""There has been a decrease in diversity ( probably due to global catastrophes ) . This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38""","""No , it 's not . The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways , and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since . First , ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler ( fewer cells , for example ) than they are today , so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated . The more complex any system is ( the more parts it has , and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be , etc . ) , the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is . So the simpler developmental processes ( simpler adult-form end product , fewer interactions between developmental genes , etc . ) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale ' change to be incorporated into that animal 's ontogeny , though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today , it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated ( note that 'large-scale change ' refers to the adult form : the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation , in an early developmental stage ) . This it not to propose Goldschmidt 's `` hopeful monsters `` that occur due to 'macromutations ' , but rather an intermediate position between that and the `` only micromutations `` view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism . And , as just mentioned , mutations in developmental processes ( even ones that resulted in 'macromutations ' in the adult form ) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today 's . Second , ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today , so there was a huge number of open niches : a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet . An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches ( by means of a `` semi-macro `` mutation , the product of a change in a developmental gene ) would have faced little if any competition . The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation ( s ) , that would otherwise likely have been eliminated , to persist . ( The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination : over time , internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up ' with the change in morphology : these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record ) . Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion ' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times .""",DISAGREE

It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` libertyÂ´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment .

At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens .

2272,"""The latter , of course . I 'm not anti-marriage . In fact I 've been `` institutionalized `` with the same woman for 26 great years so far . I just do n't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage . All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law , additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally , believe is deviant . ( not deviant as in `` sinister `` , but in the sense of `` abnormal `` ) But that 's not to say that I 'm closed minded and ca n't be persuaded otherwise . There are other things that I consider deviant , but can tolerate , none-the-less .""","""Well , it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral ( in the sense that it is abnormal ) . This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves . I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others , especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness . But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules . It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue . Well , I suppose what I just said does n't really mean much of anything , just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as `` deviant `` behavior in my book . It is not something that must be `` tolerated `` , it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature . You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage . I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt , but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality , freedom , and happiness . Let me expand on that . Equality seems very simple to explain . Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law . This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex , but it is not , and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else . This simple fact violates equality , and I think this is clear and easy to understand . What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant . Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second . The more equality is removed , the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group . If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm , the first group is obligated to do so . For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil . Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand . Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples , it is not actually taking any anyone 's freedom to behave in the manner they please . Or is it ? By benefiting one lifestyle over another , the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle . Taken to the extreme , the government could just as easily imprision those who do n't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom , they just do n't have the `` benefit `` of walking around that other people get . The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends , or more accurately , the government is promoting one lifestyle over another . To any extent which the government does this , we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want . Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom , taking into consideration murder and stealing , however those are actions that cause harm to people ; they are restricted to protect the rights of others , to stop harm . I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply , and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above . In fact , same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits ( again , as I explained above ) . This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom . Finally I come to happiness : this is the end of all governments . Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible , or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can . The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness , to help the achieve the best standard of living they can , to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do , to help people in any way they can . With same-sex marriage , we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone . We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves . We have an opportunity to help people , and I am forced to conclude that we can not call ourselves equal , we can not call ourselves the land of the free , and we can not call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity .""",DISAGREE

It is what it is , regardless of how it is perceived or labeled . If you think it 's acceptable as the 'right to choose ' -- good for you ! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children ' -- good for you ! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control ... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here . I was n't . Take it for whatever it 's worth . If the issue is important to you for any reason , I encourage you to do some research on the subject . ) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion . ' According to currently accepted medical terms , 'pregnancy ' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall . And 'abortion ' is the termination of a pregnancy . So , according to the currently accepted medical terminology , the answer is no , of course not ! However , if you define 'abortion ' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization , then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes . And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no . The birth control pill has three primary functions ( as do most hormonal bc agents ) : 1 . The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation , but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill . 2 . A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it , but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it . 3 . The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus , but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall , as evidenced by a 'failure rate ' when women are on the pill . ( In other words , sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill , indicating that all three functions of the pill failed . ) It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo . ' How often this happens is uncertain ( some estimates are as high as 50 % while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits ) , but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen . Your physician may or may not be aware of this . Ask her/him if you are concerned . Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions ' because according to accepted medical terminology , pregnancy does n't begin until implantation . While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong , ' some people DO believe it is wrong . If you do believe that abortion ( as in terminating the development of an entity after conception ) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation . Hope this is helpful information ! The Bootfitter""","""I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill , and they happen to get pregnant anyways , it will cause you to miscarry ( not always , but sometimes ) .

3991,"""Change Nobody Believes In A bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on Christmas eve . Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new `` manager 's amendment `` that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations . Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning . After procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24 . Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce . The rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that `` reform `` has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state . An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week . The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later . * * * & # 8226 ; Health costs . From the outset , the White House 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story . '' Anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , `` Mr. Obama said over the weekend . This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it . The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer WellPoint , which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill . WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178 % . A small business based in Richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23 % increase . Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family with two kids living in Indianapolis will pay 106 % more . And on and on . These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare & # 8212 ; above and far beyond the status quo & # 8212 ; because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would distort insurance markets . All but a handful of states have rejected regulations like `` community rating `` because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care , increasing costs for everyone . Benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics . As for the White House 's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed `` waste , `` even Victor Fuchs , an eminent economist generally supportive of ObamaCare , warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic . '' The oft-heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not ' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice , `` the Stanford professor wrote . & # 8226 ; Steep declines in choice and quality . This is all of a piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the $ 33 trillion the U.S. will spend on medicine over the next decade should go . This centralized system means above all fewer choices ; what works for the political class must work for everyone . With formerly private insurers converted into public utilities , for instance , they 'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost-conscious decisions . Unnoticed by the press corps , the Congressional Budget Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so `` substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types , prices , and number of private sellers of health insurance `` that companies like WellPoint might need to `` be considered part of the federal budget. `` With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in Washington 's hands , quality will decline . Ultimately , `` our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all , `` as Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages . Take the $ 2 billion annual tax & # 8212 ; rising to $ 3 billion in 2018 & # 8212 ; that will be leveled against medical device makers , among the most innovative U.S. industries . Democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-coated stents are driving costs too high , though patients and their physicians might disagree . '' The Senate is n't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day , `` Brent Eastman , the chairman of the American College of Surgeons , said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing ObamaCare . For no other reason than ideological animus , doctor-owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they 're allowed to treat . Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare will `` destroy over 200 of America 's best and safest hospitals. `` & # 8226 ; Blowing up the federal fisc . Even though Medicare 's unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008 , Democrats are crowing that ObamaCare will cost `` only `` $ 871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $ 132 billion , according to CBO . Yet some 98 % of the total cost comes after 2014 & # 8212 ; remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week & # 8212 ; and most of the taxes start in 2010 . That includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 that rose to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid 's final machinations . Job creation , here we come . Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but does n't start paying benefits until late in the decade . But the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5 % next year and deeper after that . Everyone knows the payment cuts wo n't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower . The American Medical Association 's priority was eliminating this `` sustainable growth rate `` but all they got in return for their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend . The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic . To hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet , the Senate sets up government-run `` exchanges `` that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400 % of the poverty level , or $ 96,000 for a family of four in 2016 . Supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers do n't provide insurance or work for small businesses . As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute points out , this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation & # 8212 ; whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits & # 8212 ; very differently . Under the Senate bill , someone who earned $ 42,000 would get $ 5,749 from the current tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $ 12,750 in the exchange . A worker making $ 60,000 would get $ 8,310 in the exchanges but only $ 3,758 in the current system . For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill is not just a new health system but also `` a new welfare and tax system `` that will warp the labor market . Given the incentives of these two-tier subsidies , employers with large numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert them into `` contractors `` or do more outsourcing . As more and more people flood into `` free `` health care , taxpayer costs will explode .

7991,"""There have been so many school shootings over the last 40 years that researchers have been able to develop a profile of the typical mass murderer . They 're called `` active shooters `` or `` active killers `` and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes . After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 , police changed their tactics . The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position . Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer . The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene . They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions . This technique was employed by police departments around the country . Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007 . Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people , 30 fatally , in the university 's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes . That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four . Once again , the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself . Law enforcement reviewed its tactics . Based on the Virginia Tech data , experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter . Every minute the officer waits for back-up , another three or more people could die . In other words , while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer , it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so . Tactical Defense Institute in Adams County , Ohio developed one of the first `` single officer response `` programs in the nation . TDI was teaching the tactic even before Virginia Tech . Now the National School Resource Officer Organization ( NSRO ) is using TDI instructors to teach school resource officers how to confront a gunman immediately . Locally , all Blue Ash police officers are trained in these new tactics in large part because their chief , Col. Chris Wallace , is also a TDI instructor . The other statistic that emerged from a study of active killers is that they almost exclusively seek out `` gun free `` zones for their attacks . In most states , concealed handguns are prohibited at schools and on college campuses even for those with permits . Many malls and workplaces also place signs at their entrances prohibiting firearms on the premises . Now tacticians believe the signs themselves may be an invitation to the active killers . The psychological profile of a mass murderer indicates he is looking to inflict the most casualties as quickly as possible . Also , the data show most active killers have no intention of surviving the event . They may select schools and shopping malls because of the large number of defenseless victims and the virtual guarantee no on the scene one is armed . As soon as they 're confronted by any armed resistance , the shooters typically turn the gun on themselves .""","""I believe that explains everything very well .

9231,"""A PRACTICAL MAN 'S PROOF OF GOD The existence of God is a subject that has occupied schools of philosophy and theology for thousands of years . Most of the time , these debates have revolved around all kinds of assumptions and definitions . Philosophers will spend a lifetime arguing about the meaning of a word and never really get there . One is reminded of the college student who was asked how his philosophy class was going . He replied that they had not done much because when the teacher tried to call roll , the kids kept arguing about whether they existed or not . Most of us who live and work in the real world do not concern ourselves with such activities . We realize that such discussions may have value and interest in the academic world , but the stress and pressure of day-to-day life forces us to deal with a very pragmatic way of making decisions . If I ask you to prove to me that you have $ 2.00 , you would show it to me . Even in more abstract things we use common sense and practical reasoning . If I ask you whether a certain person is honest or not , you do not flood the air with dissertations on the relative nature of honesty ; you would give me evidence one way or the other . The techniques of much of the philosophical arguments that go on would eliminate most of engineering and technology if they were applied in those fields . The purpose of this brief study is to offer a logical , practical , pragmatic proof of the existence of God from a purely scientific perspective . To do this , we are assuming that we exist , that there is reality , and that the matter of which we are made is real . If you do not believe that you exist , you have bigger problems than this study will entail and you will have to look elsewhere . THE BEGINNING If we do exist , there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be . Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning . The Bible says , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth `` ( Genesis 1 :1 ) . The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning . The idea is that matter has always existed in the form of either matter or energy ; and all that has happened is that matter has been changed from form to form , but it has always been . The Humanist Manifesto says , `` Matter is self-existing and not created , `` and that is a concise statement of the atheist 's belief . The way we decide whether the atheist is correct or not is to see what science has discovered about this question . The picture below on the left represents our part of the cosmos . Each of the disk shaped objects is a galaxy like our Milky Way . All of these galaxies are moving relative to each other . Their movement has a very distinct pattern which causes the distance between the galaxies to get greater with every passing day . If we had three galaxies located at positions A , B. and C in the second diagram below , and if they are located as shown , tomorrow they will be further apart . The triangle they form will be bigger . The day after tomorrow the triangle will be bigger yet . We live in an expanding universe that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every passing day . Now let us suppose that we made time run backwards ! If we are located at a certain distance today , then yesterday we were closer together . The day before that , we were still closer . Ultimately , where must all the galaxies have been ? At a point ! At the beginning ! At what scientists call a singularity ! A second proof is seen in the energy sources that fuel the cosmos . The picture to the right is a picture of the sun . Like all stars , the sun generates its energy by a nuclear process known as thermonuclear fusion . Every second that passes , the sun compresses 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with 4 million tons of matter released as energy . In spite of that tremendous consumption of fuel , the sun has only used up 2 % of the hydrogen it had the day it came into existence . This incredible furnace is not a process confined to the sun . Every star in the sky generates its energy in the same way . Throughout the cosmos there are 25 quintillion stars [ a meaningless number , given that only some of the universe is visible ] , each converting hydrogen into helium , thereby reducing the total amount of hydrogen in the cosmos . Just think about it ! If everywhere in the cosmos hydrogen is being consumed and if the process has been going on forever , how much hydrogen should be left ? Suppose I attempt to drive my automobile without putting any more gas ( fuel ) into it . As I drive and drive , what is eventually going to happen ? I am going to run out of gas I If the cosmos has been here forever , we would have run out of hydrogen long ago ! The fact is , however , that the sun still has 98 % of its original hydrogen . The fact is that hydrogen is the most abundant material in the universe ! Everywhere we look in space we can see the hydrogen 21 cm line in the spectrum_a piece of light only given off by hydrogen . This could not be unless we had a beginning ! A third scientific proof that the atheist is wrong is seen in the second law of thermodynamics . [ Oh , Christ , not this one again ] In any closed system , things tend to become disordered . If an automobile is driven for years and years without repair , for example , it will become so disordered that it would not run any more . Getting old is simple conformity to the second law of thermodynamics . In space , things also get old . Astronomers refer to the aging process as heat death . If the cosmos is `` everything that ever was or is or ever will be , `` as Dr. Carl Sagan is so fond of saying , nothing could be added to it to improve its order or repair it . Even a universe that expands and collapses and expands again forever would die because it would lose light and heat each time it expanded and rebounded . The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct . THE CAUSE If we know the creation has a beginning , we are faced with another logical question_was the creation caused or was it not caused ? The Bible states , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. `` Not only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause_a creation_but it also tells us what the cause was . It was God . The atheist tells us that `` matter is self-existing and not created. `` If matter had a beginning and yet was uncaused , one must logically maintain that something would have had to come into existence out of nothing . From empty space with no force , no matter , no energy , and no intelligence , matter would have to become existent . Even if this could happen by some strange new process unknown to science today , there is a logical problem . In order for matter to come out of nothing , all of our scientific laws dealing with the conservation of matter/energy would have to be wrong , invalidating all of chemistry [ Physics , XXXXX ] . All of our laws of conservation of angular momentum would have to be wrong , invalidating all of physics . All of our laws of conservation of electric charge would have to be wrong , invalidating all of electronics and demanding that your TV set not work ! ! Your television set may not work , but that is not the reason ! In order to believe matter is uncaused , one has to discard known laws and principles of science . No reasonable person is going to do this simply to maintain a personal atheistic position . The atheist 's assertion that matter is eternal is wrong . The atheist 's assertion that the universe is uncaused and selfexisting is also incorrect . The Bible 's assertion that there was a beginning which was caused is supported strongly by the available scientific evidence . THE DESIGN If we know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused , there is one last question for us to answer -- what was the cause ? The Bible tells us that God was the cause . We are further told that the God who did the causing did so with planning and reason and logic . Romans 1:20 tells us that we can know God is `` through the things he has made. `` The atheist , on the other hand , will try to convince us that we are the product of chance . Julian Huxley once said : Â “ We are as much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides . We have just happened , and man was made flesh by a long series of singularly beneficial accidents.Â ” The subject of design has been one that has been explored in many different ways . For most of us , simply looking at our newborn child is enough to rule out chance . There are Modern-day scientists like Paul Davies and Frederick Hoyle , and others , that are raising elaborate objections to the use of chance in explaining natural phenomena . A principle of modern science has emerged in the 1980s called `` the anthropic principle. `` The basic thrust of the anthropic principle is that chance is simply not a valid mechanism to explain the atom or life . If chance is not valid , we are constrained to reject Huxley 's claim and to realize that we are the product of an intelligent God . THE NEXT STEP We have seen a practical proof of God 's existence in this brief study . A flood of questions arise at this point . Which God are we talking about ? Where did God come from ? Why did God create us ? How did God create us ? All of these and many more are answered in the same way_by looking at the evidence in a practical , common sense way .

7977,"""SAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge challenged the backers of California 's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday to explain how allowing gay couples to wed threatens conventional unions , a demand that prompted their lawyer to acknowledge he did not know . The unusual exchange between U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker and Charles Cooper , a lawyer for the group that sponsored Proposition 8 , came during a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the measure as discriminatory under the U.S. Constitution . Cooper had asked Walker to throw out the suit or make it more difficult for those civil rights claims to prevail . The judge not only refused but signaled that when the case goes to trial in January , he expects Cooper and his legal team to present evidence showing that male-female marriages would be undermined if same-sex marriages were legal . & # 8216 ; Naturally procreative relationships & # 8217 ; The question is relevant to the assertion that Proposition 8 is constitutionally valid because it furthers the states goal of fostering `` naturally procreative relationships , `` Walker explained . '' What is the harm to the procreation purpose you outlined of allowing same-sex couples to get married ? `` Walker asked . '' My answer is , I do n't know . I do n't know , `` Cooper answered . Moment later , after assuring the judge his response did not mean Proposition 8 was doomed to be struck down , Cooper tried to clarify his position . The relevant question was not whether there is proof that same-sex unions jeopardize marriages between men and women , but whether `` the state is entitled , when dealing with radical proposals to make changes to bedrock institutions such as this ... to take a wait and see attitude , `` he said . '' There are things we ca n't know , that 's my point , `` Cooper said . '' The people of California are entitled to step back and let the experiment unfold in Massachusetts and other places , to see whether our concerns about the health of marital unions have either been confirmed or perhaps they have been completely assuaged. `` Walker pressed on , asking again for specific `` adverse consequences `` that could follow expanding marriage to include same-sex couples . Cooper cited a study from the Netherlands , where gay marriage is legal , showing that straight couples were increasingly opting to become domestic partners instead of getting married . '' Has that been harmful to children in the Netherlands ? What is the adverse effect ? `` Walker asked . & # 8216 ; Proof of no harm ? & # 8217 ; Cooper said he did not have the facts at hand . '' But it is not self-evident that there is no chance of any harm , and the people of California are entitled not to take the risk , `` he said . '' Since when do Constitutional rights rest on the proof of no harm ? `` Walker parried , adding the First Amendment right to free speech protects activities that many find offensive , `` but we tolerate those in a free society. `` Walker made clear that he wants to examine other issues that are part of the political rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage but rarely surface in courtrooms . Among the questions he plans to entertain at the trial are whether sexual orientation is a fixed or immutable characteristic , whether gays are a politically powerful group , and if same-sex marriage bans such as Proposition 8 were motivated by anti-gay bias .""","""Judge challenges backers of gay marriage ban - Crime & amp ; courts- msnbc.com It 's funny .

3819,"""The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel In Canada and Great Britain deceitful `` safe storage `` laws allow government invasion of gun owners ` homes . These laws are all part of the gun grabbers ` wholesale attack on private gun ownership . Responsible gun owners store their guns safely . For over a century , the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage . Partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low . In spite of this , anti-gun politicians , and the anti-gun groups are working to turn `` safe storage `` into a tool for disarming the American public . Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain . There , gun owner apathy has allowed `` safe storage `` to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms . Great Britain British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for `` reasonable `` restrictions on their rights . But as many Britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice . British law merely mandates that guns be stored in `` a secure place. `` But Britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control , Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . Although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes -- sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition . A person buying a low-powered L5 rimfire rifle may have to spend Â£100 on a safe . A person with five guns may be ordered to add a Â£1000 electronic security system . One effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle-income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history . Of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the British police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . The requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the British Parliament . Rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti-gun administrators . ( Similarly , in the United States , police administrators have used the Brady Act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses . Brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the Act makes such abuses inevitable . ) Canada In Canada , the Criminal Code prohibits `` careless `` storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations . What does this mean in practice ? Consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 : Hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house . A few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident . Aghast , the friend called the police . The police arrived at the couple ` s home and bullied their way in . Searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom . No children lived in the home . The couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm . A 67-year-old single woman ran a small boarding house in Ontario . A downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her . Worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets . She was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations . She had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field . Recently in Winnipeg , a 72-year-old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication . Someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home . '' Yes , `` she replied , `` my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room. `` The police came over immediately and began searching the home . They found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement . They also found a .25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into . The 73-year-old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent . Other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent . ( His neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful . ) Eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest . Gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work . In Medicine Hat , Alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named Larry Davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house . The Medicine Hat police did nothing to verify the informant ` s claim , other than looking up Larry Davies ` address in the phone book . The SWAT team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the Davies household , and forced Larry Davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads . A search of the house revealed : Mrs. Davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day ; four grams of marijuana ( weighing less than a United States 25-cent piece ) ; and a disassembled FN/FAL rifle in a basement closet . Apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged Mr. Davies with unsafe storage of a firearm . Happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever Mr. Davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done . And Canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws . But even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years . As David Tomlinson , President of Canada ` s National Firearms Association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home . Canada ` s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to `` inspect `` private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with . Gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control : they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In 1965 , the United States Supreme Court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason . ( Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) ) . For the same reason , privacy-minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer . Former-President Clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new Canadian gun law ( Bill C-68 ) which authorizes searches without probable cause . SMALL STEPS Gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps . Restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear `` reasonable `` when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps . Gun storage laws are . . . unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In Canada , prohibitionists , such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration `` will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect. `` As the next step , the anti-gun lobbies in Canada have begun pushing for `` community storage. `` Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station . When you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station . The anti-gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident . There is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year . To counter the anti-gun groups , gun owners in Canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense . They gave up the moral case for self-defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes . And by agreeing to `` safe storage `` laws , the Canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self-defense in a sudden emergency . With so much ground already conceded , Canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft . Even conceding on the `` community storage `` issue will do gun owners no good . In 1996 , the British Parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single-shot .22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges . The new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the British anti-gun lobbies . In 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns . The Future Who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive `` community storage , `` with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns ? Who can believe that the American anti-gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with `` safe storage `` laws ? Storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner . What makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances . Safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the National Rifle Association . In the hands of anti-gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , `` safe storage `` becomes an Orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms . Home safety is the responsibility of the family , not the state .

Vernick ; Lisa M. Hepburn A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts . http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect . California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law , twice what the federal government has passed . We publish the gun laws for several states , and distribute books on the subject for 24 states . Our definition for a gun law , while slightly different than yours , is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books . If it affects private ownership , possession or use of firearms , it is included . A huge list of laws that are not included , which would raise the counts dramatically , is printed in the front of each of our books ( e.g. , regs for police , criminals , military , Native Americans , federal officials , etc . ; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents ) . Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because , for example , a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects . The Brady law , for example , with its 3,000 words , controls airline baggage , point-of-sale purchases , development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more . Counting it as `` one law `` would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists . For specifics , I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes ; Texas had 226 ; Arizona 183 ; Florida 229 ; and Virginia , in out just released 7th edition , has 193 . Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short , would n't you agree ? You 'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here : gunlaws.com - FAQ The real question though is this : Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned ? The answer to that is no , and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine . New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public , possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one , creating victimless crimes , and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom .

9463,"""Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation. `` They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch `` mode rather than `` dart `` mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . '' Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , `` Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances. `` The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall. `` '' I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , `` she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . '' This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , `` he said .""","""One wonders if there was n't an element of racism involved .""",DISAGREE

Bell , which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800 's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it , which he named eugenics . In America , Galton 's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport , who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the `` germ-plasm `` of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated . Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy , which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act , which kept out `` inferior `` people from Southern and Eastern Europe . Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists ' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives , which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit : Galton suffered from severe depression ; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic ; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy . In America and elsewhere , enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites . In Britain , people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals , and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals . Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists , who saw it as further justification for abolishing class Â— after all , once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied . In this country , eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt , the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations . It galvanized temperance advocates , suffragists , and liberal American churches and synagogues .

6221,"""SACRAMENTO Â— A bill that would ban the public display of unloaded guns narrowly passed the Senate Public Safety Committee Tuesday . The 4-3 vote sent the legislation carried by Assemblywoman Lori SaldaÃ±a , D-San Diego , to the Appropriations Committee and likely on to the Senate floor where the final outcome is in doubt , particularly in this election-year atmosphere . The measure has passed the Assembly earlier this month . California law currently allows unloaded handguns to be carried in public . SaldaÃ±aÂ ’ s measure , Assembly Bill 1934 , is supported by a statewide police chiefÂ ’ s organization and major gun-control groups . They argue that police are being required to respond to reports of guns , draining resources and creating dangerous situations because authorities have to assume the guns are loaded . This Â “ open carry movementÂ ” goes Â “ beyond whatÂ ’ s safe and whatÂ ’ s responsible , Â ” SaldaÃ±a said . Emeryville Police Chief Ken James added , Â “ Open carry is not just a threat to public safety , itÂ ’ s a threat to officers.Â ” Several opponents of the measure countered that they have a constitutional right to bear arms and noted that there have been no police problems directly associated with someone carrying an unloaded weapon in plain sight . Some also contend the legislation would make criminals out of hunters , campers and others who take their weapons along for protection and target shooting . Sen. Rod Wright , D-Inglewood , and a gun owner , defended the right to carry weapons in public as long as they are unloaded . Responding to complaints that the guns intimidate and make people uncomfortable , Wright said he has a tall friend with tattoos who intimidates and makes people uncomfortable . Â “ Are we going to ban him next ? Â ” Wright asked as he voted against the bill . But Sen. Gil Cedillo , D-Los Angeles , said that it is too dangerous to allow Â “ gang-bangersÂ ” to openly tote weapons . Â “ There are Second Amendment rights , Â ” he said . Â “ There are also Second Amendment responsibilities , Â ” Cedillo said .""","""So law-abiding citizens are being considered gang-bangers in California ? Yeah that 's really nice to know .

But the same poll also found that 59 percent of residents surveyed favor putting the issue to a public vote in a ballot measure . The poll found that 37 percent oppose bringing the issue to a citywide vote . The poll also identified significant differences on the same-sex marriage issue along racial lines . But the opposition to gay nuptials by blacks doesnÂ ’ t appear to be as strong as local gay marriage opponents have predicted . An overwhelming 83 percent of whites responding to the poll said they favor legalizing same-sex marriage , while 12 percent oppose it . A bare majority of 51 percent of blacks said they oppose legalizing gay marriage in the District ; 37 percent polled said they support it . According to the survey , 4 percent of whites and 12 percent of blacks said they had no opinion on the issue . Although the pollÂ ’ s finding that an overall majority of 56 percent support legalized same-sex marriage at this time , LGBT activists familiar with ballot measures on the issue in other states could view the D.C. poll results with caution . In a number of states , including California , voter support for same-sex marriage dropped sharply following well funded and what LGBT activists called highly negative campaigns waged by same-sex marriage opponents . Voter initiatives or referenda seeking to prohibit same-sex marriage have won in every state where theyÂ ’ ve been placed on the ballot . In D.C. , a 1978 law barring ballot measures that would result in discrimination against minorities protected by the cityÂ ’ s Human Rights Act has so far prevented local opponents of same-sex marriage from putting the issue up for a public vote . The opponents have vowed to continue to challenge city rulings against a marriage ballot measure in court . The Post poll shows that white and black voters differ sharply over whether to bring the gay marriage question to a public vote . Among blacks , 70 percent responding to the poll favor holding a citywide vote on the issue , while 25 percent say a ballot measure should not be held . Six percent had no opinion .

Moreover , not only the differences in sources of ideas , but also different premises scientists have held about evolution , human nature , God , and how science should be done , have always underscored the controversies about human evolution. `` Wolpoff , M & amp ; Caspari , R , ( 1997 ) `` Race and Human Evolution : A Fatal Attraction `` , p12 . I have been at pains to quote this , not because their work is in the field of epistemology ( for when I post evidence , from epistemological sources , I get the reaction I just got from you ; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists !

Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living . Is it equal ?

If you approach the scriptures as intended and stated , you start to resemble EZ and Arch ( amongst others ) , but , their practices are cultic , seperationistic and exclusive and in the world of science and knowledge ... complete hogwash . Who 'd want to be something so regressive and backwards thinking ? Adopt the ideals and practices of the contemorary man ... and you have something approaching a double bind . Thus , you have to start pruning away cognative disonance conflicts from one side or the other . Usually it 's the system that causes you the most problems in your current life so you prune parts of the bible out you do n't like . In weeding , Jo skips over the parable of the vines . Where some vines that bear no good fruit/ are withered , are removed and replaced with new ones . This is the believer who no longer practices , withering in 'faith ' and being removed from Gods vineyard of believers . And those who convert being added in . John 15 Jo sees the passages that state `` Everything is permissable but not everything is beneficial `` as a carte blanch for being able to do anything and still go to heaven as 'once saved , always saved ' which is ironic as that 's an attitude extremist calvinist take ... it also denies free will . The ability to accept and reject this free gift of grace on a moment to moment basis . The gift is freely given to all but not all accept this gift and those who accept it can lose it . Sure , everythign is permissable simply because you can do everything but , it 's not beneficial . It could hurt you physically or emotionally or even lose you your salvation . Those who believe in once saved , always saved can often get a sense of spiritual pride and conciet . Thinking they can do things since they can justify them to themselves and if they can do that , God 's okay with it . End result is them being Matthew 7:21 The bible does NOT say `` a believer may do anything and still be saved. `` If it does somewhere , maybe Jo can point it out with appropriate scripture . As I states , and as the bible backs up numerous times , the free gift must be ACCEPTED . Think of it like this ; you MUST have the ticket to get into heaven . The only way to get this ticket is for you to get one from the ticket giver . The 'cost ' for this ticket is said to be free . The ticket giver does NOT force you to take the ticket , nor does He slip it into your back pocket while you 're not looking . Simply ASK and your shall RECIEVE . Matt 7:7-12 That 's not to say the apostate message of the pseudo-Christian is n't appealing . It tickles the ears mightily . It even allows one such as myself to enter into the small gate at the end of the narrow path ... you know the one `` But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life , and only a few find it. `` Matthew 7:14 Heck , I 've freely broken EVERY commandment and without repentance . That I did so for mostly noble reasons is beside the point . Would be nice to get an easy out and be treated as those who followed evry rule to a T. @ Matthew S , `` Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things ? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand ? `` The part where my Son turn his back on me , runs far away and came to a bad end out of my sight and control ... all because he exercised his free will to do so . Heck , I 'm personally going through this right now with my eldest . The story of the prodigal son has a meaning to it you know . Turn back and repent before it 's too late . At NO time did the father rush after his errant son nor compel him to return . Heck , the father did n't even know that the son spent all his inheritance and was starving UNTIL he came home . In the end , what I find amazing is why pseudo Christians even hang on to the thin vinear of Christianity ... it 's like walking with a crutch when they know they do n't need it .

6615,"""I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the `` it 's not in the Constitution `` position . This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state `` or `` collective `` right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` libertyÂ´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens . Just for info sake , Harlan 's dissent is also quoted in the plurality ( Stevens concurring ) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 502 ( 1977 ) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 543 ( 1961 ) And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd .

Are you not familiar with the Grants ' work ? This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years . Here 's the situation . Essentially , there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major . One is a small seed - easily cracked . The other is a large hard shelled seed . At one time , during a drought , the Grants observed that some native finches , Geospiza fortis , evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger , hard shelled seeds . In other words , the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end . The article ( and I presume the paper published by the Grants ) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch , G. magnirostris , with a correspondingly larger bill . The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size , having similar beak size . As a result , they directly competed for scarce resources . As a result , large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage . As a result , the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller , more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up , while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger , hard shelled seeds .

This time it 's the proposed `` Regulatory Czar `` who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate . His name is Cass Sunstein , and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear . For starters , Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence . He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that `` we ought to ban hunting. `` And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ) , he said : I think we should go further ... the law should impose further regulation on hunting , scientific experiments , entertainment , and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering . It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here , and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction . There are many possibilities . If that 's all Sunstein believed , he would be dangerous and extreme , but not necessarily kooky . Unfortunately , when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting , this is where he goes beyond extreme . In Sunstein 's world , animals should have just as many rights as people ... and they should be able to sue humans in court ! '' We could even grant animals a right to bring suit without insisting that animals are persons , or that they are not property , `` Sunstein said on page 11 of Animal Rights : Current Debates and New Directions ( 2004 ) . Well , that 's a relief ... he is at least willing to concede that animals are not persons ! But he would still have animals suing humans , apparently , with more enlightened humans representing the cuddly critters . Imagine returning from a successful hunting trip ... only to find out that you 've been subpoenaed for killing your prize . Who knows , maybe Sunstein would have the family of the dead animal serving as witnesses in court ! By the way , if you 're wondering what he thinks about the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , you wo n't be surprised to know that Sunstein is a huge supporter of gun control . In Radicals in Robes : Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts are Wrong for America ( 2005 ) , Sunstein says : Almost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine .... [ O ] n the Constitution 's text , fundamentalists [ that is , gun rights supporters ] should not be so confident in their enthusiasm for invalidating gun control legislation . Hmm , what part of `` shall not be infringed `` does Sunstein not understand ? Imagine the power that Sunstein could have as the Regulatory Czar -- the nickname for the person heading the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ( OIRA ) in the White House . As the Regulatory Czar , he could bring about changes in the regulations that affect hunting , gun control and farming . In short , he could make your life hell . Senator Saxby Chambliss ( R-GA ) objected to his nomination several weeks ago , preventing him from being unanimously confirmed . That means that the Senate will now need to garner 60 votes to confirm this radical , kooky choice to the OIRA . No doubt , many of the people our President wants to associate with are radical kooks . First , there was the Rev . Jeremiah Wright ... then there was the self-avowed communist ( Van Jones ) who was nominated for the Green Jobs Czar ... now , there 's an extreme animal rights activist who wants to take away our guns and get Bambi to sue us in court .

A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , last fall . Katyanne Marie Kibby , 25 , was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin . She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby , the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder , 24 , and David Guy McKay , 23 . Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10 . That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008 . Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations . The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby . Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didnÂ ’ t use them , a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby . Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby , saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues . Kibby , who lives in Houston , is free on bond . If convicted , she could face 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . She could not be reached for comment . WhatÂ ’ s funny is that , even as this is going on , the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights . You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC , but IÂ ’ ll bet KibbyÂ ’ s name has never been mentioned on the network . Not to mention CrowderÂ ’ s name or McKayÂ ’ s . As far as IÂ ’ m concerned , violence has no place in American politics right now . I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when , as Thomas Jefferson put it , the Â “ tree of libertyÂ ” will need to be replenished once again by the blood of Â “ patriots and tyrants.Â ” But that time is certainly not now .

3170,"""Sunday , July 26 , 2009 Legal immunity set for swine flu vaccine makers : What are the implications ? AP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe got a swine flu vaccine scoop -- yet the news is four weeks old . It turns out that DHHS Secretary Sibelius has not only given immunity to the makers of Tamiflu and Relenza for injuries stemming from their use against swine flu . She also granted immunity to future swine flu vaccines and `` any associated adjuvants , `` which was published in the June 25 , 2009 Federal Register . Here is the start of his story : The last time the government embarked on a major vaccine campaign against a new swine flu , thousands filed claims contending they suffered side effects from the shots . This time , the government has already taken steps to head that off . Vaccine makers and federal officials will be immune from lawsuits that result from any new swine flu vaccine , under a document signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , government health officials said Friday . Since the 1980s , the government has protected vaccine makers against lawsuits over the use of childhood vaccines . Instead , a federal court handles claims and decides who will be paid from a special fund . The document signed by Sebelius last month grants immunity to those making a swine flu vaccine , under the provisions of a 2006 law for public health emergencies . It allows for a compensation fund , if needed ... However , the compensation issue is more difficult than portrayed by Stobbe . The special vaccine court to which Stobbe refers applies only to specially designated vaccines , excludes most adult vaccines , and swine flu is not a designated vaccine for which compensation can be paid . The 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREPA ) allows the DHHS Secretary to invoke almost complete immunity from liability for manufacturers of vaccines and drugs used to combat a declared public health emergency . PREPA removes the right to a jury trial for persons injured by a covered vaccine , unless a plaintiff can provide clear evidence of willful misconduct that resulted in death or serious physical injury , and gets permission to sue from the DHHS Secretary . There has been no government funding of its potential compensation mechanism , to date . Furthermore , a PREPA declaration explicitly shields `` government program planners `` who arranged for the liability waiver . Pharmaceutical companies making swine flu vaccine today may have demanded immunity from liability before agreeing to begin a crash program to manufacture H1N1 vaccine for the government . According to a 1978 report by the National Academy of Sciences , something similar happened with the 1976 swine flu program : ... all manufacturers made plain that they would not insure themselves , not even temporarily . Instead they put off plans to bottle their vaccine ; pending legislation they would keep the stuff in bulk . Each weekÂ ’ s delay in moving from bulk to bottles assured at least as much delay in starting inoculations . Thus ended hopes of immunizing anybody in July or even August ... Behind MerrellÂ ’ s firmness , there almost certainly was fear of the intentions of the casualty insurers . In May it was no secret that at least some major firms wanted to steer clear of swine vaccine . As early as April 8 Merck had been warned by its primary insurer that coverage for swine vaccine was Â “ consideredÂ ” not Â “ feasible Â… at virtually any price.Â ” So Merck 's President had written Mathews and everyone else in sight . Merrell , then about to switch insurers ( for unrelated reasons ) is reported to have been told by its new one something of the same sort at about the same time .

Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world . Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims . Professor Phil Jones , the head of the Climate Research Unit , and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University , who has been an important scientist in the climate debate , have come under particular scrutiny . Among his e-mails , Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the `` trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [ in temperature ] . `` Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that `` scientists often used the word 'trick ' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret .

No , I said all the reasonable people . I do not believe all pro-choice people are reasonable , or even the majority of them ( in America at least ) .

I firmly believe that it will only happen with a massive re-ordering of our society , respecting what women and mothers go through in all aspects of life . I do n't think that will happen no matter if abortion is legal or illegal . I firmly believe that abortion is a symptom of ills with society and society 's view of women throughout the ages , and the fact that women have not been able to 100 % control if they become pregnant . The only reason it is out of the shadows , so to speak , is that we have the technology to have safe and effective abortions . Making abortion illegal will not make it go away and will only add insult to injury by violating women 's rights . As I 've said , abortion will not be rarer because of litigation no matter if `` pro-life people `` or `` pro-choice people `` have their way . Women themselves need to be supported and respected in order for that to happen . Making abortion illegal will not curb abortions , it violates rights and shows extreme disrespect to women . Keeping abortion legal may not curb them itself ( only the personal views of women will do that ) , but it shows respect for women and their choices and it does not violate women 's rights either . I believe keeping abortion legal is the first step to reducing their numbers , but it is only a step . I do doubt that Americans have the energy to actually change our society to the point I believe is necessary . However , one step is better than pushing their heads back under the water as pro-life people advocate .""",DISAGREE

Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment . In a given environment ( e.g . a very cold region ) , some ( e.g . the long-haired dogs ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others , and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population , but it ca n't create any new information . An example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . We take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . Over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . So , as a result , the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information . What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment ? Dogs ( varying in hair sizes ) . What did we get after a short amount of time ? Dogs ( only the long hair size ) . There is no evolution occuring here , we had dogs before , dogs after . The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it . This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins , i.e . variation within a kind and that kind 's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it . So even if the peppered moth case was really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation . Anyone who says other wise , does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth 's total DNA content , i.e . their genome , in which case you might have a point . Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept ? His method appears to be good , i.e . using observations and experimental data , as well as repeatability . He is using the scientific method ( in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias . This is yet to be determined , however . Can you keep us informed of his progress ?""","""Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon .

Such empty assertions can not be proven wrong . Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God , and that is what scientists study . There are lots of scientists , evolutionary biologists among them , who believe in a Creator God . Science is not a matter of proving something right . Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed . In science , the facts are the observations . The process of science is a process of testing those theories , again and again . The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong .

Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others ? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and `` God did it `` offers no predictions . However , if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events , you have made assertions that can be checked . For example , if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago , then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that . But clearly there are . And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that . For example , SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth . It 's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method . It is 170,000 light years away . In other words , SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago . A creationist 's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth , complete with the history of an explosion that never happened .

I can also build red muscle by doing anerobic exercise , and white muscle by doing aerobic exercise ; all these are ways in which my body can adapt to demands placed upon it . Now , if underneath all this the genome was rock-solid and invariant , you would be correct : organisms would adapt epigenetically and that would be the end of it . However , genetic variation does occur . And once you admit the possibility of genetic variation , the genomic gaps between species cease to be an insurmountable problem for evolution : we can envisage that gap narrowing as we move back in time to a point where two species were one . Genetic adaptation , unlike epigenetic adaptation , does not lie within the individual ; it is distributed across the gene-pool . Mating produces new combinations , and selective environments can enable some combinations to flourish better than others , even once volitional and epigenetic adaptation is taken into account . It 's a mistake to characterise the ToE as being only about RM+NS . Even just in terms of genes , recombination through breeding is very important . But genetic variation does require an explanation , as does the remarkable correlation between the genetic and phylogenetic trees and the fossil record .

Heck , stick a bacteria in the presence of an antibiotic and what does it do as a response ? Mutate ! How can evos suggest that the gene somehow gets the signal to mutate , yet has no idea how to mutate or what to accomplish by mutating ?

Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective ? I mean , how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man , because of our linear view of time , is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred , that God is then an epic liar ? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation ? Is He the liar ? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space ? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective , is n't it obvious child ! But for a more practical answer , imagine this . In the beginning , space was a void which spanned all of eternity . Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other , and that person was my God Yahweh . And in one second or minutes time , he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed , at different intensities and strengths , which causes them to burn out at different times . But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time . Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds . He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time . To the ants on the ground , if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed , it would represent a great distance , but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time . Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective . Time is plastic . Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only . That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best . But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion . The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again , arbitrarily call our universe , but throughout all of time and space . But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes , it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us . But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God , you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time . So by that definition alone , it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there .""",DISAGREE

2950,"""Sigmund Freud divided all people into `` believers `` and `` unbelievers.Â ” Unbelievers include all those who consider themselves cynics , skeptics , scoffers , agnostics , or atheists . Believers include the rest , whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis , Augustine , Tolstoy , and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives . Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is `` Anyone `` out there . He described his worldview as secular and called it `` scientific , `` and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than `` carefully scrutinized observation what we call research. `` Therefore no knowledge , he said , can be derived from revelation or from intuition . He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being `` resembling a man but magnified in every respect , an idealized superman , reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples. `` He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview . Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father . He added that `` religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality. `` He concluded that the religious view is `` so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it. `` Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano , a devout believer , when Freud wavered in his atheism , he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life . A year before he died , Freud wrote to Charles Sanger , `` Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever. `` When we carefully assess the record , however , we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed . Certainly he did refer to himself often as , `` an infidel Jew , `` and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe , especially the Judeo-Christian view . He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective . Yet , for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues ; he just could not leave them alone . He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them . In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth . A great deal of evidence exists that Freud 's worldview proved less than comfortable for him . Faith was by no means a closed issue for him , and he was extremely ambivalent about God 's existence . Anna Freud , Sigmund 's daughter who died a few years ago , explained to me the only way to know her father : `` Do n't read his biographies ; `` she instructed , `` read his letters. `` Throughout Freud 's letters are statements such as , `` If someday we meet above , `` `` [ my ] one , quite secret prayer , `` and statements about God 's grace . During the last thirty years of Freud 's life , he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian , Oskar Phister . It 's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian . He admired Phister and wrote , `` You are a true servant of God . . . [ who ] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets . You did good this way even to me. `` He later said that Phister was , `` In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God. `` Source : : Click Here Armand M.

Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true ( God in the Dock ( Grand Rapids , MI : Eerdmans , 1970 ) pp . 52-53 ) : Â ‘ If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision , then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident , and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too . If so , then all our thought processes are mere accidentsÂ—the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms . And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else 's . But if their thoughtsÂ—i.e . of Materialism and AstronomyÂ—are merely accidental by-products , why should we believe them to be true ?

Belief in catastrophism , usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation . 6 . There was a sudden creation of the universe , life , and energy from nothing . None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory . Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence , it is a much more unassuming theory . ID proposes the following : 1 . Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design . 2 . Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity . 3 .

1176,"""Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe , where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 ( beginning in Denmark ) , there is a correlation between same-sex marriage ( or civil unions ) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease , syphilis . In `` Forsaking All Others ? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage ' on Risky Sex , `` Thomas S. Dee writes : One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals . A specific implication of this claim is that Â “ gay marriageÂ ” will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) . In this study , I present a simple 2-period model , which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce ( or increase ) the prevalence of STI . Then , I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates . These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe , where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989 . The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates . However , these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV . [ from the paper 's abstract ] Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project . He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books , including No Child Left Behind ? : The Politics and Practice of School Accountability , Developments in School Finance , and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths . Dee 's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships : These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce , perhaps dramatically , the social costs associated with STI like syphilis . In the United States , over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 ( CDC 2004b ) . And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $ 1 billion , which reflects in large part , the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV ( CDC 1999 ) . However , the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health . For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage , these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships . The full paper provides extensive economic analysis , including charts and graphs , and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept . http : //ricksincerethoughts.blogspot .... educes-vd.html""","""Yes , and it reduces a much needed population growth too .""",AGREE

For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) It makes sense that Eagles , Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . So why have n't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ? One reptile has a type of third eye , but it is n't for sight nor is it permanent . It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . Then it is covered by scales . Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ?

Now let 's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . They too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement .

He 's gotten really good at cribbing and misrepresenting , but that does n't mean that he ca n't be refuted ... or has n't been refuted ... or has n't been refuted repeatedly ... or has n't been refuted repeatedly on numerous discussion boards ... If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for `` support `` and figuring out how to spin it , we would n't be having this conversation . Let 's put it this way . Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry . One day your friend comes in and says , `` Dude ! The prof 's off his rocker ! I have proof that he 's lying to us ! `` You ask Fred for some supporting evidence , and he disappears for a while . A while later , you see Fred again . '' Dude , `` he says , `` I told you . Check this out . Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction ' to lengthen carbon chains . Wittig ! It 's all a ruse ! He 's been telling us about this , but that 's not what actually happens ! ( And man , do n't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization ; that one 's a real doozy ! ) '' You stare at him blankly , point him to the appropriate scientific papers , even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself , but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide . Finally , Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry . It turns out that sulfur can catenate , too , he says . This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds . In fact , Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education , training , and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists ' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into `` Grignardism. `` Incredibly , Fred does n't seem to notice that other students , the professor , graduate assistants , scientific articles , and common sense all contradict him . When presented with these problems , Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment , as science as a whole has only one purpose : promoting Grignardism . Fred repeats this every week , with the same argument every time , dressed up just a little bit different . Every week , dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in , inundating little Fred with questions he ca n't answer and observations he ca n't explain . When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence , he disappears again ... Only to start anew the next week . How long until you no longer take Fred seriously ? Do you think I 've made up this whole scenario ? Head over to IIDB and search for threads started by supersport . My story is a sadly accurate representation , although it is much too short to instill in you the understanding of the full depth of supersport 's ... `` behavior. `` IIDB has numerous practicing scientists and generally well-educated people ; they thrashed sport to pieces every single time .

Say for example you catch a crack dealer with a gun . He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack , but in my experience if he pleads guilty it would be a very , very rare occurrence for him to receive an active sentence of more than 2 years per charge for being a drug dealer . This is because the judge can suspend any part of or all of his sentence , and pursuant to this judicial authority the average sentence I see for per count of selling crack is 12-18 months . But if you catch him with a gun while he is selling , then the punishment for just on offense of having the gun is an automatic 5 years which can not be suspended . I have seen many instances where the defendant gets far more time for having a gun than what he received for the actual underlying crime he commits either with or while having the gun . But to come back to the issue , if registration is aimed at identifying and/or preventing illegal transfers and illegal possession of firearms , then in my opinion that goal can not be reached because it can not be enforced . Felons found in possession are already prosecuted for having the gun without a requirement to register them . A registration requirement will not aid in either their detection or prosecution because they will not comply with the registration requirementÂ ’ s command that they incriminate themselvesÂ—and no law can force them to register their guns so long as the 5th .

Their babies had died , and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers : an internal wound called a fistula , which left them incontinent and soaked in urine .... Obstructed labor can kill the mother , too , or crush her bladder , uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby & # 8217 ; s skull . The injured tissue dies , leaving a fistula : a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina . In some cases , the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out . Some women also have nerve damage in the legs . One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were . Many stood barely five feet tall , with slight frames and narrow hips , which may have contributed to their problems . Girls not fully grown , or women stunted by malnutrition , often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/he ... 4hospital.html""",AGREE

Though I have n't experienced it myself , I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience . However , I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties . Some of these might include : - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child . This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children . It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare , whereas , if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared , she could be a better mother to those future children . - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma , whereas , if she secretly got an abortion , she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment . - Of course , there are the cases of rape , incest and a threat to the life of the mother , but I think we mostly agree on those . I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby , so I believe that women should have the right to choose ( at least during the first and second trimester ) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process . Yes , theoretically , they could put the child up for adoption , but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman , including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child . I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby , but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision . Unfortunately , though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades , there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood ( marriage is not always a possibility ) .

1670,"""I thought it would be nice to start a thread where people can express their views on the issue of abortion in a more detailed way than they might when responding in a debate .""","""Following the original purpose of this thread , I will summarize my own views on abortion . ( Note , this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called `` Survey of views on abortion `` ) : For me , the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus . On the side of the rights of the mother , there is a very important right to the control over one 's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one 's will . Some may say that , in agreeing to have sex , a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy , but I strongly disagree . A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used . It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood . The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women , religious or non-religious , conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons . Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts . So , women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex . In the case of unwanted pregnancies , it is a significant burden that they never agreed to . If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy , it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies . On the other hand , one has the rights of the fetus . What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities . For me , the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind . I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others . My view is that , once a mental existence begins , the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother 's rights over her own body , under most circumstances . The neurological view is that a mind can not exist before the third trimester . Therefore , I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester . For that third trimester , I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother 's life or physical or mental health ( ex . leading to , say , paralysis or strong possibility of suicide , etc . ) and , in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late , to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer ( i.e . mercy killing ) . Otherwise , I believe abortions should be restricted . If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester , she should have to carry the pregnancy to term ( minus the perviously mentioned exceptions ) . She would have had ample time to decide . Lastly , here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester : Part 4 of http : //www.2think.org/abortion.shtml http : //7e.devbio.com/article.php ? ch=21 & amp ; id=162""",DISAGREE

Not people Open Carrying firearms . Sorry but , Ignorance of the law is no excuse !""","""Let me interject a little 4th . Amendment primer hereÂ… . The terms Â “ Terry stopsÂ ” and Â “ Terry frisksÂ ” come from the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 ( 1968 ) . Cases often hinge on the particular facts involved , and the facts in Terry were : `` A Cleveland detective ( McFadden ) , on a downtown beat which he had been patrolling for many years , observed two strangers ( petitioner and another man , Chilton ) on a street corner . He saw them proceed alternately back and forth along an identical route , pausing to stare in the same store window , which they did for a total of about 24 times . Each completion of the route was followed by a conference between the two on a corner , at one of which they were joined by a third man ( Katz ) who left swiftly . Suspecting the two men of Â “ casing a job , a stick-up , Â ” the officer followed them and saw them rejoin the third man a couple of blocks away in front of a store . The officer approached the three , identified himself as a policeman , and asked their names . The men Â “ mumbled something , Â ” whereupon McFadden spun petitioner around , patted down his outside clothing , and found in his overcoat pocket , but was unable to remove , a pistol . The officer ordered the three into the store . He removed petitioner 's overcoat , took out a revolver , and ordered the three to face the wall with their hands raised . He patted down the outer clothing of Chilton and Katz and seized a revolver from Chilton 's outside overcoat pocket . He did not put his hands under the outer garments of Katz ( since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon ) , or under petitioner 's or Chilton 's outer garments until he felt the guns . The three were taken to the police station . Petitioner and Chilton were charged with carrying concealed weapons . The defense moved to suppress the weapons. `` From these facts we developed the law involving temporary stops and pat downs of citizens . The law regarding Â “ Terry stopsÂ ” can be best summarized as follows : `` [ A ] n officer who has a reasonable , articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may conduct a brief , investigatory stop . While Â “ reasonable suspicionÂ ” is a less demanding standard than probable cause , there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stopÂ… . The officer must be able to articulate more than an Â “ inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or Â ‘ hunchÂ ’ Â ” of criminal activity `` . Illinois v. Wardlow , 528 U.S. 119 , 119 and 123-124 ( 2000 ) Therefore , a Â “ Terry stopÂ ” is a Â “ seizureÂ ” under the 4th . Amendment , but it is not a full arrest . The detention and questioning must be brief . Taking a man out of a theater and questioning him would be a Â “ Terry stopÂ ” which would require Â “ reasonable , articulable suspicionÂ ” of criminal activity . From the article it appears the judge has ruled at a preliminary motions hearing that the officers did not have the required level of suspicion to detain the man . A Â “ Terry friskÂ ” is a Â “ weapons friskÂ ” or Â “ pat down.Â ” It requires an additional reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify this Â “ friskÂ ” or Â “ pat downÂ ” search . In Terry the suspicion of armed danger arose from the type of suspected criminal activity ( planning a robbery ) in which it is reasonable expect that one or more of the three men involved would be armed with a weapon . Note , however , that a Â ‘ Terry friskÂ ” is limited to the outer layers of clothing . The hands can not penetrate pockets , for example . The Â “ friskÂ ” is a search for weapons only . If the officer feels what he reasonably believes is or could be a weapon then he is allowed to penetrate the pocket , for example , to get the object out . But this is allowed only where it is Â “ immediately apparentÂ ” from the Â “ friskÂ ” that the object is or could be a weapon . If the article is correct , then the search involved in the theater case went far beyond a weapons Â “ pat down.Â ” Absent some exigent circumstance ( and the article does not mention that any existed ) the level of search done in this case required Â “ probable causeÂ ” Â—which is the standard of proof needed to justify a full arrest for a crime . It is possible that both the detention and the search will be held unconstitutionalÂ—but the violation is of the 4th and not necessarily the 2nd . Amendment . ( Both of which read Â “ the right of the peopleÂ ” , in case anyone has forgotten . Will anyone here suggest the armed man can not sue because the phrase Â “ The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizuresÂ ” guarantees only a Â “ collectiveÂ ” and not an individual right ? ) I also want to address the articleÂ ’ s brief mention of Florida v. J.L . because it is misleading : `` United States Supreme Court in Florida v. J.L . ( 2000 ) ( detaining man on mere report that he has a gun violates the Fourth Amendment ) . `` This gives the impression that SCOTUS has ruled the police can not detain someone who is reported as having a gunÂ—which is not the case . Â “ J.L.Â ” was a 16 year old juvenile and it was illegal for him to have a handgun . That Florida law was not in dispute , nor was the ability of the officer to make a Â “ Terry stopÂ ” and conduct a Â “ pat downÂ ” for a weapon if he had the required level of Â “ reasonable , articulable suspicionÂ ” that J.L . had a gun . The issue was not whether the police could detain and frisk a man on a report of having a gun , but on whether the anonymous report in that case claiming he had a gun was credible enough to be relied upon to provide Â “ reasonable , articulable suspicionÂ ” : `` An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not , without more , sufficient to justify a police officer 's stop and frisk of that person . An officer , for the protection of himself and others , may conduct a carefully limited search for weapons in the outer clothing of persons engaged in unusual conduct where , inter alia , the officer reasonably concludes in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons in question may be armed and presently dangerous . Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 , 30 . Here , the officers ' suspicion that J. L. was carrying a weapon arose not from their own observations but solely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller . The tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make a Terry stop : It provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant 's knowledge or credibility. `` Florida v. J. L. , 529 U.S. 266 ( 2000 ) As I said , cases hinge on the particular facts involved . In my experience news reporters often make broad assumptions without understanding how each individual fact fits into the legal puzzle .""",DISAGREE

Back in the 1890 's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution ( Spencer for , Weismann against ) . Supporters of Herbert Spencer , notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn , realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally , so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments . This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York , and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments . Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example , Bumpus 's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals . Specifically , Bumpus ( 1898 ) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation . In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups ( the old original and the more diverse offshoot group ) to a third location , and showed that each group continued true to type , notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads . This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature , and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal . .......... Starting around 1909 , Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions . He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics . However , he realized after a long while ( 1932 ) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics . All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause , and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis , as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics , and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics . However , the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter .""","""So , he 's immune to new information that contradicts his beliefs .

6048,"""MEXICO CITY Â– Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out , lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings , including the massacre of 17 people last week , prosecutors said Sunday . After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the Attorney General 's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption . '' According to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ' weapons for executions , `` office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference . The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation . No charges have yet been filed . Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon , which is near Gomez Palacio . In that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women . Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison . Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon , the capital of northern Coahuila state , he said . At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15 , local media reported . Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels . '' Unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , `` he said . Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the Zetas . Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people . Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences . But Sunday 's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes . Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation `` can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we can not allow this kind of thing to happen again. `` Also Sunday , Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez , across from El Paso , Texas . Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan , 39 , as a top member of La Linea gang , the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel , saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes . Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments , moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez . Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma , though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General 's Office , as Ledezma is . La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate . Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan , but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram ( pound ) of cocaine and two guns . His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim . Also Sunday , the Attorney General 's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns , 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house . Elsewhere in Tamaulipas , police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos . Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized . Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico 's pipelines . In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero , authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations , including three in or around the resort of Acapulco . Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month .""","""So somebody try and tell us , that with stuff like this going on , that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico .""",DISAGREE

As we all accept , creationists as well , sometimes things go wrong during this replication process . Sometimes , the viral DNA is rendered inactive . This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it . But sometimes , this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing . Therefore , the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error ( ERV ) permanently and then passes it on . Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome , we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years . This is testable , every human on the planet has the same ERV 's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history . For evolution to be false , and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false , you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs . When we looked , we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences . The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution .

God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand , just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand . How we came about was n't as pertinent as why and who , so thats what He told us . It could kinda be like the stork . You know your kids wo n't understand ( and do n't yet need to ) about sex and child birth , so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents ( not all , I know I wo n't , but SOME do ) say that the stork brings babies . They put a myth in place of a fact that the children do n't need to know . Furthermore , even if God did explain evolution , if the men He explained it to did n't understand . Which they probably would n't have seeing as they had no sense of time , biology , genetics , or even basic anatomy ( all pertinent to evolution ) then they would have transcribed something VERY different .

In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions . A modern day example would be the theory of relativity . Have you ever had it explained to you . I have . It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it . Anyway , when my father explained it to me when I was about 16 , we talked about it for several hours ( literally ) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions , my brain pretty much reduced it to `` As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast .

' Time IS relative. `` Now I still do n't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light , or even how you would return to their same 'time .

In West Africa , only about 1 percent of pregnant women have Caesarean deliveries because the procedure isnÂ ’ t widely available . When labor is obstructed , the baby is trapped in the pelvis , and labor can last up to a week . Women who survive this ordeal can develop a hole in the bladder called a fistula . This injury Â— caused by the prolonged pressure of the babyÂ ’ s head on the soft tissues of the pelvis Â— causes continuous and uncontrollable loss of urine . The millions of women in Africa and Asia who suffer from fistulas are often shunned by their communities for the rest of their lives . In Liberia , I operated on a woman who had endured a fistula for 35 years , and it took only 20 minutes to repair her injury . Including a month of hospital care and the surgical supplies needed , the operation costs about $ 300 to $ 450 . All a clinic needs is spinal anesthesia , intravenous fluids , basic surgical instruments , sutures and a catheter for draining urine . ItÂ ’ s even easier to prevent these injuries from happening in the first place . With supervision , local village Â “ labor monitorsÂ ” can learn to track the progress of a birth and send the woman to a hospital when labor lasts too long . Trained birth attendants can detect abnormalities in labor by using a partograph Â— a simple graph that charts the progress of labor and tells attendants when to intervene . The World Health Organization tested the partograph in 35,000 births in Southeast Asia and found that using it cut the number of prolonged labors almost by half .

Miller , 307 U.S. 174 , 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , 818 , 83 L.Ed . 1206 ( 1939 ) ( second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' ) '' Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland ( 1st Cir . 1984 ) `` Appellant Raymond Rybar , Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C . Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) , which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun . ' On appeal , he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress ' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment . Neither challenge is persuasive .... In support , Rybar cites , paradoxically , the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) , where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge . Rybar draws on that holding , relying on the Miller Court 's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' Brief of Appellant at 24-25 ; Miller , 307 U.S. at 178 . Drawing from that language the contra positive implication , Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) is clear , a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required , and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment .... We note first that however clear the Court 's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character , it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection . In fact , the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself , but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use ' and militia related activity .... Rybar 's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia , ' as required in Miller , 307 U.S. at 178. `` U.S. v. Rybar ( 3rd . Cir . 1996 ) `` the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment , narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia .... `` United States v. Graves ( 3rd Cir . 1977 ) `` The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller , supra at 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia. `` United States v. Oakes ( 10th Cir . 1977 )""",DISAGREE

However , there are no such things as Â ‘ brute factsÂ ’ ; all facts are interpreted . Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument , then the ChristiansÂ ’ presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts . Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions Â— see Naturalism , logic and reality .""","""This is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble . All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right ? Well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens . Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly . Should he be allowed to sit in judgement ? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position : by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race . Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy . We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence . Ah , but ! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted ? One might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically . But it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts ' . The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic . To someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts ' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way . In short , following Ken Ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight . We can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another . I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are , in Ken 's eyes , inviolate . This is hardly the result Ken could have intended . What 's gone wrong ? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly ? The answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level . Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place . The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed . This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma : Good axioms yield accurate predictions . As Ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation . But the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not . In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find . This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality . This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal . The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate ' would invalidate his axiom . So , part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark . The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions . We should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms . We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation . We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies . All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact . Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about ; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs ; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood ; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past . But these rationalisations entail further predictions : we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can . If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we do n't . If fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone . If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air . And so on . Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected ' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed . And that 's the bottom line : Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur .""",AGREE

8500,"""Reading the opinions in McDonald v. Chicago , you might think it was as much a civil-rights case as a gun case . In the ruling , the Supreme Court decided 5Â–4 that the Second Amendment applies to states and localities , not just the federal government , and struck down ChicagoÂ ’ s handgun ban . The four conservative justices , along with Justice Anthony Kennedy , formed the majority . One of the conservatives , Clarence Thomas , also filed a concurring opinion . The main disagreement betwee the two opinions concerned whether the Fourteenth AmendmentÂ ’ s Â “ privileges or immunitiesÂ ” clause or its Â “ due processÂ ” clause is the best way for the Court to apply constitutional protections to state and local governments . But in the process of making their arguments , both opinions emphasize the racial history of the Fourteenth Amendment Â— the story of the postÂ–Civil War South and the federal governmentÂ ’ s crusade to ensure fair treatment for blacks therein . The heart of the problem was that , in an effort to stave off rebellion and maintain the racial caste structure that had developed under slavery , state and local governments refused to respect freedmenÂ ’ s constitutional rights . Crucial to the SouthÂ ’ s efforts were gun-control laws that applied to blacks and blacks alone . This does not show that modern gun controllers are racist , or even that the modern gun-control movement has Â “ racist roots , Â ” as some have suggested Â— the concerns that motivate Sarah Brady are neither the same as nor descended from the concerns that motivated racist southern governments . But this does show that when a government has the ability to forbid gun ownership , it has the ability to render groups it dislikes helpless to defend themselves . Regardless of whether modern gun control accomplishes its purpose of reducing crime Â— and for the record , there is no evidence it does Â— a free society should fear a government with such power . The SouthÂ ’ s campaign against black gun ownership , not surprisingly , began long before the Civil War . Two slave rebellions in the 1820s stoked whitesÂ ’ fears , and in response , Â “ many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well , Â ” Thomas notes . Georgia forbade blacks to Â “ own , use , or carry fire arms of any description whatever.Â ” Florida empowered Â “ patrol [ s ] Â ” of white citizens to Â “ search negro houses or other suspected places , for fire armsÂ ” ; blacks caught with guns Â— whether slave or free Â— were brought to the Â “ nearest justice of the peaceÂ ” for Â “ whipping on the bare back , not exceeding thirty-nine lashes.Â ” ( They could escape punishment by providing a Â “ plain and satisfactoryÂ ” explanation . ) It wasnÂ ’ t just blacks , but also anti-slavery whites , whom governments tried to disarm . For example , during the Â “ Bleeding KansasÂ ” period Â— a series of violent skirmishes in the 1850s between pro- and anti-slavery elements in that future border state Â— there were attempts to take guns from the Â “ free-soilers.Â ” As the majority opinion in McDonald notes , the 1856 Republican-party platform described this as a violation of the right to keep and bear arms . When the war ended , fear of rebellion peaked , and southern governments ramped up their efforts . Some states passed laws banning black gun ownership or gun carrying , and there was a Â “ systematic effortÂ ” to disarm the freedmen who had served in the Union army and then returned to their homes in the South . Roving bands of exÂ–Confederate soldiers , many affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan , took arms from blacks by force while official law enforcement looked the other way . In South Carolina , a group of black citizens wrote the following to Congress : Â “ We ask that , inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of this State to pass an act to deprive us [ of ] arms be forbidden , as a plain violation of the Constitution.Â ” The problem wasnÂ ’ t just that the laws were discriminatory , forbidding blacks but not whites to own guns Â— it was that the government had the right to ban gun ownership by the law-abiding at all . Even if the South had banned all gun ownership , disarmed blacks would have had to deal with the armed and racist Â “ state militia and state peace officers , Â ” the justices note . They might have added that , without technically discriminating by race , the South could have used the techniques it later employed to keep blacks from voting Â— grandfather clauses , literacy tests , etc . Â— to exempt whites from facially non-discriminatory gun bans . ( We see a modern analogue to these policies in laws that prevent the poor from owning guns . It costs $ 340 , nonrefundable , just to apply for a gun permit in New York City , and the rich and famous seem to have a lower likelihood of being rejected . Also , the gun-control movement periodically goes after Â “ Saturday-night specialsÂ ” Â— that is , handguns cheap enough that the poor can afford them . ) It was gun-control laws Â— along with other laws that violated virtually every right blacks had Â— that led to the Fourteenth Amendment , which authorized the federal government to ensure that state and local governments respected citizensÂ ’ rights . The FreedmenÂ ’ s Bureau Act of 1866 , passed just two years before the amendment was approved , made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms was an important right for freed blacks to have : Â “ The right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery.Â ” Advocates of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 cited the disarmament of freed blacks as a reason the law was necessary . These laws , however , didnÂ ’ t work . Southern governments refused to enforce them , and the Supreme Court Â— which was far less powerful then than it is today , anyhow Â— did not intervene . To drive the point home that the South had to respect blacksÂ ’ rights , including the right to bear arms , Republicans in Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment ( they had the numbers to do this because they had refused to seat the Democrats the South had elected , many of whom were former Confederate soldiers ) , sent it to the states for ratification , put the former Confederate states under martial law via the Reconstruction Acts , and made their ratifying the amendment a condition of ending military rule . The Supreme CourtÂ ’ s decision gives Americans a lot to think about Â— from the Â “ privileges or immunitiesÂ ” clause to the CourtÂ ’ s proper role in enforcing the Constitution . But whenever we discuss gun control , we need to remember that a government capable of gun control is capable of tyranny . Both the majority opinion and ThomasÂ ’ s concurrence in McDonald Â— following in the steps of works such as Stephen P. HalbrookÂ ’ s Securing Civil Rights Â— perform the crucial service of explaining how important that fact was in the wake of the Civil War .""","""So you see , Brady , you 're wrong again . The McDonald ruling was n't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups . Quite the opposite .

Fossil Coelocanth : Fossil Coelocanth No , it was based upon the fact we had n't seen one , yet there were fossils of them . Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed , that 's how science works , when better data is found , the theories are changed .""","""First of all , let 's compare the `` B `` specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me . Secondly , shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish , but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented , Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years . One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish , or any fossil for that matter , would be the story of the coelacanth . This is a genuine fish story . For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth , a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians , had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years , at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record . No doubt about it , the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs , at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938 . Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found . In the June , 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths , where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers , thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth , despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years . The ancient coelacanths , from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day , extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals ( 63 million years ) , before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs ( 100 million through 225 million years ago ) , before the Triassic age of early mammals ( 200 million through 250 million years ago ) , before the Permian age of early reptiles ( 250 million through 300 million years ago ) , before the Carboniferous age ( 300 million through 370 million years ago ) , all the way back to the Devonian era , 400 million years ago in the fossil record , according to the time scale of the evolutionists . Initially it could n't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years . Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found , J.L.B . Smith , a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University , South Africa , pronounced it an entirely new genus and species , differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils . Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name , Latimeria chalumnae , after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish , and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured . Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth ? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988 , there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one . They state : `` LIKE CARBON COPIES , the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match. `` They go on to report : `` Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth . The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany . It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B . Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch , although he had never seen a live specimen . '' ( 30 ) Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears , differing very little in structure , showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it 's existence . It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years . I think there 's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us . This is true of virtually all fossils found , whether sharks or sand-dollars , they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species . Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians ( the class of fish including the coelacanth ) , because they had bony elements in their fins , may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea , which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land . This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article : `` Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists : whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins . Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom , we never saw any of them walk , and it appears the fish is unable to do so . '' ( 31 ) It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish , amphibians and reptiles do , but gives live birth . Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish , this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate . The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months , two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live , wriggling , little , sharks , some lizards give live birth , so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish , amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil Record Here 's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth . Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed , they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish 's evolutionary journey . They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish , but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer . Here is Hans Fricke 's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo 's story is based upon . And notice the last paragraph in the story . The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY 'S THIS : I confess I 'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins . Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers . Alas , that does not seem to be the case . For every myth we dispelled , however , I 'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made . In short , we have just begun to know the coelacanth.So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist , even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth , but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence , was a complete myth . Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution .""",DISAGREE

Incidentally , I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism . It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species . Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century . It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was , indeed , a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it .

I think what you would find would be a public that does n't think anything through and works on a gut feeling of what they would want . For example , if you asked `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester even if the woman was struggling in college `` then you 'd probably get 60 % of people to say they would allow it . If you asked it `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester as a form of birth control `` then you 'd probably get 60 % saying no or more .
