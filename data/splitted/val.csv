7800,"""How did a lizard evolve an avian lung ?""","""Well , the easy answer is that a lizard did n't evolve an avian lung . There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung . However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians . And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds , having arisen from an ancestral archosaur . The dinosaurs , through the ornithodirans , also arose from archosaurs . So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs . So some birds have a system of ( usually ) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs . Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration , they do have other functions , such as thermoregulation and weight reduction . Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds . However , there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first . Thus , in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight . But some birds , current and fossil , do not have pneumatic bones . For example , Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons . But of course , Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight . Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say . To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself .""",DISAGREE,"""How did a lizard evolve an avian lung""","""There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians ."""

' In the second edition , he changed the citation to ' a national survey that I conducted . ' He has also incorrectly attributed the figure to newspaper polls and Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck. `` http : //www.townhall.com/columnists/m ... 20030205.shtml So was it a newspaper poll ? Did Kleck conduct it ? Now Lott claims he did it . If true , he must have been lying when he said that others conducted the study . '' He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott ca n't identify or produce. `` Interesting how he ca n't remember anyone who helped him .""","""Yet , tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll . Regardless , in his report it was a minor point . From a realistic standpoint , it took nothing away from the report when he removed it . Lott was investigated for this , just like Bellisiles . He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct ( unlike Bellesiles ) . When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together , the folks investigating him did n't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn ; t remeber the details of where that number came from . Again , though , he ended up removing that number from his report ( the single place that it appeared ) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it . Here is how he responded to the article you link to : http : //johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.html It is rather interesting , and well documented . It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article , such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck .""",AGREE,"""Well , it was n't just a footnote that Lott supposedly lost .""","""Yet , tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll ."""

546,"""O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesnÂ ’ t have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . But lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance . I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then AmericaÂ ’ s armies for one simple reason . The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg ( I know my spelling sucks ) like attack . Most of the ICBM silos are n't connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . Now , you may be wondering what am I trying to say here . Well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated , it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy 's capital city to make attack impossible . Again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? Even if that worked the U.S. , like Russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked . But lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , REALLY cool party some XXXXX colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know , thatÂ ’ s a pretty low number for the invasion of America ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles ( again lets assume somehow AmericaÂ ’ s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all AmericaÂ ’ s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . The hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2 . Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3. all groups preparing for `` battle `` so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 . It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y. , N.Y. , and .... wait AmericaÂ ’ s satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would n't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit ( effectively sitting ducks ) .

546,"""O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesnÂ ’ t have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) .

We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth . from http : //www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/r ... laboration.htm Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter .""","""Foolish Clergymen .

If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted ? If the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . That is Absolutly ridiculous . Why stop with that ? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God ? Oh but then it continues doesnt it ? Yes it does ! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole . It is torn apart . You can not pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs .

Although at first blush , gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal , on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all . The unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime . 1 . Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive . Do you know what it takes to run a database that big ? You need 19,000 changes daily , just to keep up with people who move every ten years . Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs , payroll , parking and dry cleaning bills . It 's a government jobs program all by itself , all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime . How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done ? That 's right , none , and the planners know that . All that money and time , invested on tracking the innocent . That 's why so many police departments are against it -- they 'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources , and hire clerks instead of cops . 2 . Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime . Under registration , activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon . Think about that . Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest , if the property is n't on the government 's master list . Boy , that does n't sound like the American way . No other evil is needed , there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place . Paperwork equals prison . That 's just wrong . 3 . Registration , if enacted , will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade . How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants , before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties ? People get what they want either way , it 's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it . With respect to guns , the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy , for gun runners . 4 . People have said to me , `` But Alan , if all guns were registered and there was a crime , then you could tell. `` Tell what ? If your neighbor is shot , that 's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius . The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive , opportunity , witnesses , physical evidence , the murder weapon . Police are n't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers . Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component . 5 . You do n't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people , do you ? Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York , California and Louisiana , and global history for the past century , this could n't really happen , do you think ? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America , with its Bill of Rights ? The guarantees against confiscating property , unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power . Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures ? ( Unfortunately , it 's a long list of usual suspects . ) And what about the so-called First Amendment test ? If it 's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too . Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers ? Why indeed . Pile logic on logic , some people just feel the government should register everything , just to keep control . When government has that much control , you no longer possess your liberties . You 're living where government lists define who can do what , and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely . This form of `` gun control `` is n't about guns , it 's about control . I might favor registration if the system would include criminals . In fact , I 'd favor testing the system on them first . But the U.S. Supreme Court , in a widely known case ( Haynes v. U.S. , 1968 ) , had determined that a felon who has a gun can not be compelled to complete such forms , because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination . That 's right , mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime , and is therefore prohibited . * Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the `` news `` media , engorges the federal or state bureaucracy , and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms . It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words , and should be rejected outright . Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve , protect and defend , and deserve to be removed from office . Sincerely , Alan Korwin , Author Gun Laws of America * NOTE : This case only concerned a limited class of weapons , `` destructive devices , `` which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act . Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor , and not the transferee , of such devices to file papers , and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem . In U.S. v. Freed , 1971 , the Court agreed the problem had been fixed ( for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case ) . A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem . A prohibited possessor can not have a firearm at all , so mere possession is a serious crime . An additional charge for failing to register the gun that ca n't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case . However , possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon , with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure . The innocent would have to register to remain legal , the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself .""",DISAGREE,"""Gun registry has been a failure""","""The unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction"""

8247,"""I do n't have a large amount of interest in this topic and thus have n't heard alot of argument for or against it . I do n't have an opinion and stand no chance against those who know beyond infinite times more on this topic than I do . But regardless , I still have a question . Maybe I 'm wrong but , is n't lowering shootings a siginificant point in those who want to ban guns ? So they want to make the guns illegal and thus the only place they would be available is in the `` black market `` . Now we all know that guns in cases serve as a form of self protection from other people who would want to commit harm to the indiviusal . It is simply an average law abiding man who wants to have this pistol or handgun to protect him and or his family from those who would want to bring harm upon him family . The illegalization of these handguns would make it virtually impossible for those law abiding to get one of these guns in hopes of protecting his loved ones . I suppose a hope for those for the illegalization is that this would keep guns out of the hands of criminals . But that does n't make much sense .

If `` nature `` meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist , hmm . They would have been `` eliminated `` because heterosexuality is far superior . Think again . The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission ( bacteria dividing ) , asexual reproduction ( there goes your `` individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . None of these things require sexes of any type . Even animals that have `` normal `` sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis , in which only a female is required to produce offspring ( turkeys and lizards do this ) . If homosexuality is n't natural or is inferior , then why do we see examples of it in nature . The bonobo ( closely related to the chimpanzee ) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild , and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor . Look , you ca n't say that one way of reproduction is `` the standard `` since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways . You also ca n't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is `` natural `` is valid . Also , you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a `` greater purpose `` . By implying that something has a purpose , you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology . If you want to assume that things were given `` purpose `` by some higher being , that 's fine , but you 'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument . In science , it is impossible to assume a purpose . For example , what is the purpose of a river ? To flow to the ocean ? To carve a canyon ? To carry sediment ? You can say what something is good at doing , or what it does , but you can not say what it was `` made `` for ( purpose ) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion . As for hetero and homosexuality , it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals . Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced ? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or `` life `` , heterosexuality would be superior .

To a Darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that Â “ evolutionÂ ” has occurred . A fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered `` evolution. `` The only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . This premise , I suggest is a complete and total fraud ... and I will explain why now : LetÂ ’ s take humans and dogs , for example . When compared side-by-side , sure enough , humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not Â– and possibly the other way around . But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs do n't , does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs . Of course , there are no Â “ dog genesÂ ” or Â “ human genes.Â ” But likewise there are no Â “ tongue genes , Â ” Â “ tail genesÂ ” or Â “ toenail genes.Â ” Parts are not translated genes . Thus , the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible . But it 's worse than that . As I said before , humans have a whole slew of genes Â– theoretically , at least -- that dogs ( or other animals ) donÂ ’ t have .

ThatÂ ’ s excactly what science is doing with genetics : theyÂ ’ ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes ( the red face ) is causing the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) In reality , whatÂ ’ s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment ( turning upside down ) and then the genes are responding in kind ( turning red ) .

Currently , our RELIGIOUS discrimination protection is much stronger than our gay discrimination protection , but do you see churches being forced to perform inter-religion marriage if the church doctrine is against it ? NO ! Do you see atheists saying `` I like the look of this church . I do n't belong , but I 'm going to force you to rent the church for my wedding party anyways. `` ? ? NO ! The existing language and constitutional protections are good enough . But when given more explicit ( redundant ) wording , what do the anti-gay marriage organizations demand ? Something NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD before . They want BUSINESS OWNERS to be free to discriminate if they have `` religious objections `` ... What if their objections are NON-religious in nature ? Why is the religion supposed to get the special perk ? ? ? And as mentioned , NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD this . There were plenty of religious interpretations against black equality and interracial marriage . But did we give THEM special privilege to ignore and discriminate against interracial marriages ? NO !

We do n't start with the assumption that anything-goes ; standards are developed over time . Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry . Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage , and this is all a part of simply determining ( over time ) where those limits fall . Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process , so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening . In fact , even with civil rights itself , it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . It happened earlier than that with women 's suffrage . Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent . Some things have become rights , some have n't . It 's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards .

STRASSEL Friday , February 6 , 2004 12:01 a.m. EST History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses , men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it . There 's the hemlocked Socrates , the house-arrested Galileo , the exiled Rousseau . And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles . Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book `` Arming America. `` An academic bombshell , the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns . This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America `` but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , `` is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes. `` As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity. `` And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth. `` One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian. `` In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change .

Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity .

A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy `` then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal `` in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad .... it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant `` so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it . Too bad .... it 's true . You do n't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day . One day , He will be finished with you as well . Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this ( God is speaking ) : All these things you have done and I kept silent .

5934,"""`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because Â “ most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.Â ” That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEÂ ’ s Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for MexicoÂ ’ s problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified `` the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governmentÂ ’ s failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end MexicoÂ ’ s chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that ObamaÂ ’ s teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crewÂ ’ s hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste. `` Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction .

5934,"""`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because Â “ most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.Â ” That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEÂ ’ s Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for MexicoÂ ’ s problems .

3086,"""It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage , even if only indirectly . Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation . The belief that the Â “ sanctity of marriageÂ ” would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples , but better identifies the source of the opposition . Whether expressly or impliedly , much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere , deeply ingrainedÂ— even fundamentalÂ—religious belief . Yet , such views are not the only religious views of marriage . As demonstrated by amicus groups , other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31 This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of IowaÂ ’ s same-sex marriage ban . Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them . See Iowa Const . art . I , Â§ 3 ( Â “ The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .Â ” ) .

The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming . The GovernmentÂ ’ s expert was forced to concede that this is not correct . 2 . The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years . The Court found that the film was misleading : over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years . 3 . The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming . The GovernmentÂ ’ s expert had to accept that it was Â “ not possibleÂ ” to attribute one-off events to global warming . 4 . The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming . The GovernmentÂ ’ s expert had to accept that this was not the case . 5 . The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice . It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study : in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm . 6 . The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age : the ClaimantÂ ’ s evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility . 7 . The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching . The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim . 8 . The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously . The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia . 9 . The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting , the evidence was that it is in fact increasing . 10 . The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people . In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration . 11 . The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand . The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim .

4679,"""Just wondering , so how does a small woman protect herself from a large man ?""","""I think she is supposed to either scratch at him with her keys , or spray them with hairspray . I am sure we will se a lot more pages like the above linked in the near future . Now that Lotts research has been given the green light by the NAS , in fact , being the only body of research with which they found NO issues ( oddly enough , the anti gunners research was FULL of holes ) , there is nothing left to attack him on , and his work has been vindicated . So , lacking any real material with which to attack his actual work , the anti gunners are essentially stepping back and calling him a `` dummy head `` . In todays modern political/academic environment , what higher form of flattery can there possibly be than charachter assasination ? It is what they fall back on when they find your argument to be irrefutable . The NAS study was supposed to be `` their study `` . Instead the findings basically run that anti gun researchers are mostly liars who use HIGHLY questionable methodology , pro gun researchers are refreshingly honest , and at the end of the day , the pro gunners have won the war of statistics . It is over , there is really no point to debating it anymore . We have seen the most scritinized review of the available data EVER , and the antigunners have had the wind knocked out of their sails .

969,"""Right , that does it . So far , I considered there crusaders harmless , but this ... No more sugar , and inflammation goes away ? ! ? I see that these guys can be downright dangerous ..""","""Well it 's a bit more than that .... there 's the issue of bad fats too ... ie omega 6 fats . Ever notice how the Omega 3s in Salmon and flaxseed oil are pushed ? .... you know why ? Because Omega 3 oils , among other things , have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body . Why is it so hard to believe that if a diet that 's high in sugar leads to inflammatory diseases , that a reduction or elimination of sugar would eliminate or drastically reduce those symptoms ? I 'm actually speaking from experience . I did n't dream this stuff up . I 've lived it . I used to have a condition called chronic prostatitis ... which is an inflammation of the prostate that often happens in young men . This is not a medically curable condition . Doctors often throw antibiotics at it , but most men do n't respond to that . As a result there are thousands of men around the country who live in constant , chronic debilitating pain . I used to be one of them . But no longer . I learned the secret , which is to eliminate junk foods and sugars . After just a couple weeks of doing this my constant pain just seemed to evaporate . I have never looked back . Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always be hot , while some are cold ? Some people are just hot natured . Many times older people are cold natured .

3775,"""You 're starting to sound like someone who understands evolution . I do n't see your argument here , you 're basically supporting the steps necessary for natural selection . What you describe is one small step for evolution , you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints ( sic ) and viola , you 'll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize . You 're almost there montalban ! -Mach""","""Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man . That is the analogy I gave , and you ignored . In both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off . BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died . In once case - nylon , the other , the artificial heart . You call this evolution . Nor is it 'natural selection ' at work either , as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural . What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what ? Natural what ? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they 've learnt to hear . Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given ... `` Finally , Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e.g . K. Kato , et al. , ? A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2 ? , Microbiology ( Reading ) 141 ( 10 ) :2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] In fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . This suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria. `` '' All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein-degrading ) enzyme . This may seem surprising ? How would a loss of information create a new ability ? Answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . If this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . To put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . Indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme `` http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... e7-24-2000.asp Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk `` Whilst this particular case does not `` prove `` evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution. `` Why do they say this ?
