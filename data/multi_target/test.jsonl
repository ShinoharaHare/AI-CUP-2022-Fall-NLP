{"id": "2024", "q": "Dublin , California ( CNN ) -- It 's a Monday morning , and Vince Cefalu just got into work at his more than $ 150,000-a-year-job as a special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . '' It 's 9:30 . This is what I affectionately refer to as the cage , `` Cefalu , 51 , said . '' I am sitting here with an empty in box and nothing to do . I 'll keep you apprised. `` CNN gave Cefalu a video camera to document what he does at work . For five days , he recorded himself inside his own office . Cefalu said he was put in a job with little or nothing to do because he 's the victim of retaliation by ATF managers . After spending much of his nearly 24-year ATF career going undercover with motorcycle gangs and white supremacist groups , he now oversees equipment inventory . '' I spent my whole life standing up to bullies , `` Cefalu told CNN in an interview to air on AC360 Wednesday night . '' The bullies right now are government bureaucrats who are abusing their oath and abusing the expectations of the public . I 'm not leaving until this is resolved. `` Records show ATF supervisors claim he 's had performance and discipline issues . CNN has interviewed dozens of ATF supervisors , agents and employees around the country who said they 've been demoted or labeled troublemakers just for filing a complaint . Later on the same Monday in which he brought a video camera to work , Cefalu was still having a slow day . '' I 'm going to get something to eat , drag out the day a little bit , get some interaction with somebody ... Here I am , Safeway sandwich , a little news on , catching up on current affairs . I 've had a few phone calls , personal phone calls that I 've made , waiting for something to do. `` At 3 p.m. that day , he records himself , saying `` ... watching a little news , surfing the net , reading some e-mails , doing whatever , waiting for something to do . It 's good money for not a lot of work , I guess . I 'm being facetious , obviously. `` He said ATF managers turned against him after he reported in 2005 what he said was an illegal wiretap plan in a racketeering case . Records show ATF disputes his claims of the planned illegal wiretap . But he said that started a series of retaliatory measures that ended up in 2007 with him in a desk job . His only negative evaluation , he said , was the year after he criticized the planned wiretap . '' Had I not exposed some unethical , potentially criminal clearly outside policy conduct and actions by law enforcement that I was working with , none of this would have happened , `` Cefalu said . '' I would still be working in the field. `` '' I report to where they tell me to report to , and I sit for eight hours a day , and then I go home , `` he said . '' I do nothing. `` Cefalu filed a series of grievances and an age-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , but an administrative judge ruled against him . His attorney is appealing that decision . And over the past several years , he 's also sent letters to members of Congress complaining about alleged fraud and mismanagement at the ATF . '' It 's almost like being in an abusive relationship , actually . It 's almost like domestic violence , really , `` said Hiram Andrades , a supervisor in ATF 's Washington field office . '' It 's just you think things are going to improve with each director , you think things will get better and improve , but they don't. `` Andrades , who has a pending discrimination complaint , claims he was discriminated against because he ca n't get promoted . '' I ca n't get a promotion even if my life depended on it . If my life depended on it , I 'd be dead by now , OK ? `` Andrades told CNN . '' This type of retaliation is n't good for the agency , it 's distracting and it 's not good for the American people . We need to make better use of our tax dollars . We need to use it for the mission versus this kind of stuff . This is very distracting and not good for anybody. `` ATF has not had a permanent director since Carl Truscott resigned in 2006 . The agency is being run by Kenneth Melson , who has been deputy director since 2009 . In an interview with CNN , Melson said he was not permitted to discuss employee cases . But he insisted that he does not tolerate any type of retaliation . '' When I first came into ATF -- when I went around and talked to people at headquarters and around the country -- my specific and very emphatic message was that everyone was to be treated with respect and dignity and there would not be retaliation , `` Melson said . '' I will not stand for retaliation against people who are abiding by our orders and reporting violations of law or regulations. `` '' Every allegation of retaliation does n't mean it 's true , `` Melson said . '' Every person you talked to who perceives it 's retaliation does n't mean that it 's retaliation , because there 's been no adjudication of that . They have n't brought it to anybody to try to resolve it . Be careful when you talk to someone about retaliation , because there are many misconceptions and parameters of retaliation -- some of which are misinformed. `` Asked about an employee who does virtually nothing all day , he said : `` Well , I will certainly look into it and find out why he is not doing anything all day. `` He added , `` I will make sure that he puts in a full day 's work , because everybody is going to put in a full day 's work at ATF. `` Since fiscal 2005 , ATF has paid a total of $ 1.6 million to settle discrimination claims , according to federal government records . For the same time period , the FBI paid out $ 1.3 million and the DEA paid $ 331,755 . In addition , records show , ATF has more discrimination complaints filed per employee than the DEA or the FBI . But Melson said complaints have gone down 40 percent since last year . And ATF officials added that the U.S . Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons have more complaints per employee . John Taylor , a former ATF special agent based in Las Vegas , Nevada , said he was the target of retaliation after he wrote an anonymous letter to the agency 's inspector-general . In his 2006 letter , he alleged taxpayer money was being wasted on agents ' unnecessary trips to Las Vegas . Taylor told CNN he was the target of an investigation into who wrote the letter . '' They asked me did I write the letter . My response was , ' I do n't have to answer ' ... they tried to charge me with lying. `` He said he left ATF as soon as he was eligible to retire after 20 years , on December 31 , 2009 . '' I told my wife , I 'm not going to live if I stay here , `` Taylor told CNN . '' I was depressed . It was hell for me. `` Another agent in the Las Vegas office , who claims he was suspected of writing the anonymous letter , also alleged he was the target of retaliation by managers , according to records obtained by CNN . That agent was fired for failing to pass a firearms test , but later got his job back . ATF agents tell CNN that managers are taught how to handle discrimination complaints at supervisor meetings . CNN obtained a statement from a current ATF supervisor who attended such a meeting in March . During that meeting , ATF associate chief counsel Eleanor Loos gave a presentation to supervisors in the Atlanta field division . According to the statement , Loos stated that `` she considers the EEO process as the employees ' 'bitching platform ' and `` employees use this as a means to complain. `` '' Loos stated in a bragging manner that the EEO process can be dragged on and can take up to three years , `` the statement said . Rafiq Ahmad , the ATF supervisor who wrote the statement , added : `` This is not the first time that I have heard Eleanor Loos making similar remarks . She has presented these same remarks in presentations in New Supervisor 's training. `` Melson told CNN he had not seen the statement . '' But what I can tell you is that the direction that I have given people is to make sure that we abide by the rules of the agency , that we abide by the process of the EEO , and the ombudsman . And that 's why we have the process in place , `` Melson said . In a follow-up interview , Scot Thomasson , chief of ATF public affairs , told CNN that the bureau looked into the statements made by Loos . '' What we found is those statements were being taken out of context , `` Thomasson said . '' In addition , they were being characterized in a slanted matter by the person who wrote it. ``", "r": "Very intriguing .", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "nothing After spending much of his nearly 24-year ATF career going undercover with motorcycle gangs and white supremacist groups , he now oversees equipment inventory . '' I spent my whole life standing up to bullies , `` Cefalu told CNN in an interview to air on AC360 Wednesday night . '' The bullies right now are government bureaucrats who are abusing their oath and abusing the expectations of the public . I 'm not leaving until this is resolved. `` Records show ATF supervisors claim he 's had performance and discipline issues . CNN has interviewed dozens of ATF supervisors , agents and employees around the country who said they 've been demoted or labeled troublemakers just for filing a complaint . Later on the same Monday in which he brought a video camera to work , Cefalu was still having a slow day . '' I 'm going to get something to eat , drag out the day a little bit , get some interaction with somebody ... Here I am , Safeway sandwich , a little news on , catching up on current affairs . I 've had a few phone calls , personal phone calls that I 've made , waiting for something to do. `` At 3 p.m. that day , he records himself , saying `` ... watching a little news , surfing the net , reading some e-mails , doing whatever , waiting for something to do . It 's good money for not a lot of work , I guess . I 'm being facetious , obviously. `` He said ATF managers turned against him after he reported in 2005 what he said was an illegal wiretap plan in a racketeering case . Records show ATF disputes his claims of the planned illegal wiretap . But he said that started a series of retaliatory measures that ended up in 2007 with him in a desk job . His only negative evaluation , he said , was the year after he criticized the planned wiretap . '' Had I not exposed some unethical , potentially criminal clearly outside policy conduct and actions by law enforcement that I was working with , none of this would have happened , `` Cefalu said .

But such a `` theory `` , [ that is , a hypothesis whereby the origin/evolution of biological novelty and increased sytematic complexity and productivity is held to be directly and linearly and mechanically and deterministically traceable to accidental genetic alterations ] , becomes entirely implausible when you have `` multi-purpose genes `` , and whole genomes self-organising their own genetic 'pieces ' . Then phenotypic expression is not the sum , or anything like , the deterministic linear outcome of any given mutated gene , or collection of mutated genes , taken together . The entire fisherian notion of `` Random genetic mutation as the source of adaptive phenotypic traits `` goes straight down the tubes , -- just as it always should have done , from day one . But now you are back to where Darwin was , 150 years ago -- he had no explanation for the ORIGINS of species . All he had was a mechanism [ `` NS `` ] for the numerical distribution [ aka 'fitness ' ] of species . That `` theory `` can `` explain `` [ well , not really ] why some species are plentiful , while others are extinct , but it can not and does not explain how they 'evolved ' in the first place . It was because Darwin had this fact rubbed in his face by his contemporaries that he cribbed from Lamarck , and came up with a 'theory ' of origins that he called , 'pangenesis ' . And without `` RM `` , latterday darwinists are in the same position neo-darwinists were in prior to fisherism 's 'modern synthesis ' . They have no mechanism for the origin of traits [ evolution ] , but only one for the preservation and distribution of traits [ inheritance , heretibility , conservation ] . And a very nebulous 'mechanism ' that is , anyway . Now you may be among those who conveniently forget or ignore the fact that `` NS `` does not , and can not , account for evolution , i.e. , the origins of species , but some of us refuse to do that , despite much pressure from darwinists .

He said : `` This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons . And each time we develop something new , [ bacteria ] develop a defense for it. `` The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new . As early as 1934 , the British Medical Journal wrote about the `` War Against Cancer , `` a phrase we still often hear . But today , militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain : conservation biology ( `` invasive species , `` `` biosecurity `` ) ; global warming ( `` global war on global warming `` ) ; and biomedicine ( `` killer cells , `` `` hitting multiple targets `` ) . The attraction to such language is understandable , as it draws attention , and perhaps even funding ( who can forget US President Richard Nixon 's declaration to `` conquer `` cancer in his 1971 state of the union address , since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research ? ) . Still , some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language . For instance , scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility , warned Erik von Elm , an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors . '' One of the features of science should be to be objective , `` but war metaphors are precisely the opposite , he noted . '' These terms have an intention , they are sort of modern propaganda. `` Indeed , when Nottingham 's James referred publicly to the coming `` post-antibiotic apocalypse , `` the UK 's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering . Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it , noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff . '' This is not language , this is the way people think. `` In microbiology , for instance , scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy , and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives , said Brigitte Nerlich , professor of science , language and society at the University of Nottingham . With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , however , `` You have to look at multiple factors , and not just in terms of attack and defend , `` she said . Indeed , some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has , by introducing new selection pressures , only made pathogens stronger , while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions . Brendon Larson , assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada , argued the same of `` invasion biology , `` where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed . But in some cases , a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example , removal of the `` invading `` Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird , which used the plants as nesting habitats . '' We 're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation , that [ invasive species are ] enemies , they 're bad and we have to get rid of them , `` Larson told The Scientist . Indeed , according to Larson , the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush 's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security . Still , scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon , said Columbia University 's Barron Lerner , author of The Breast Cancer Wars : Hope , Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America . '' They 're here to stay , `` Lerner said , admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors , he unknowingly began using them himself . Remembering , as writer Susan Sontag advised , that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading , and remaining aware of metaphors ' effect on science , is the best scientists can do , Lerner noted .

{"id": "9928", "q": "GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman * More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ? A pile of three-dimensionally preserved casts of the soft-bodied Ediacaran organism Ernietta from ~545 million-year-old sediments in the Nama Group of southern Namibia . The scale bar corresponds to 15 cm . Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods . In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago . However , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story . At Weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus . Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities ( 15 ) . In the western United States , the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation . These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect . This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al . provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward . According to Condon et al. , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity . If this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse . Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations . In particular , atmospheric oxygen -- long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution -- appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges ( 16 ) . Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time . These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations . However , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history . References 1 . A. H.

{"id": "7712", "q": "A . Guns save more lives than they take ; prevent more injuries than they inflict * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense . Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year , firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year , the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers . Less than 8 % of the time , a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense . According to the Clinton Justice Department , there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year . The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of `` Guns in America `` -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police . Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year ( 1,527 to 606 ) .6 And readers of Newsweek learned that `` only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal . The 'error rate ' for the police , however , was 11 percent , more than five times as high . '' 7 * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense . Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as `` Saturday Night Specials. `` B . Concealed carry laws help reduce crime * Nationwide : one-half million self-defense uses . Every year , as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country . A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms . The results of the study showed : * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5 % , rapes by 5 % , aggravated assaults by 7 % and robbery by 3 % ; 10 and * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992 , then approximately 1,570 murders , 4,177 rapes , 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 * Vermont : one of the safest five states in the country . In Vermont , citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission ... without paying a fee ... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period . And yet for ten years in a row , Vermont has remained one of the top-five , safest states in the union -- having three times received the `` Safest State Award . '' 12 * Florida : concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state . In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida 's concealed carry law in 1987 , over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida , which in 1987 was much higher than the national average , fell 52 % during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average . 14 * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos ? No . Consider the case of Florida . A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder . 1 . During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect , alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin . 2 . And even the 155 `` crimes `` committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas , such as an airport.15 C. Criminals avoid armed citizens * Kennesaw , GA . In 1982 , this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house . The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89 % in Kennesaw , compared to the modest 10.4 % drop in Georgia as a whole.16 * Ten years later ( 1991 ) , the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72 % lower than it had been in 1981 , before the law was passed.17 * Nationwide . Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms . Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes : * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain , Canada and Netherlands : 45 % ( average of the three countries ) ; and , * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States : 12.7 % .18 Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection * Orlando , FL . In 1966-67 , the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns . The result : Orlando 's rape rate dropped 88 % in 1967 , whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 * Nationwide . In 1979 , the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes , 32 % were actually committed . But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife , only 3 % of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 Justice Department study : * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that `` a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun . '' 21 * 74 % of felons polled agreed that `` one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime . '' 22 * 57 % of felons polled agreed that `` criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police .

Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee . He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue . His book , Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America , has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate . In fact , this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993 . This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology . Even those who do n't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches , can not argue with his impeccable research and methodology . In `` A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed , `` Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that , `` What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz . The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years , namely , the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator .... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research . Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime ? It is hard to believe . Yet , it is hard to challenge the data collected . We do not have contrary evidence. `` Wolfgang , `` A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed , `` The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , at 188 . Wolfgang says there is no `` contrary evidence. `` Indeed , there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study . Even the Clinton Justice Department ( through the National Institute of Justice ) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year . See National Institute of Justice , `` Guns in America : National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms , `` Research in Brief ( May 1997 ) . As for Dr. Kleck , readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU , Amnesty International USA , and Common Cause . He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate . 2 According to the National Safety Council , the total number of gun deaths ( by accidents , suicides and homicides ) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year .

The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study 's authors , who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year . Nevertheless , the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures . The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied , and include anti-gun organizations , news media organizations , governments and commercial polling firms .

Thank you .", "r": "Well , to keep it short , I\u00c2 \u2019 ll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists . The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher , whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America . The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia : And I can not see , why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave , since they are the only true badges of liberty . . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave . He who has nothing , and belongs to another , must be defended by him , and needs no arms : but he who thinks he is his own master , and has anything he may call his own , ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses , or else he lives precariously and at discretion . And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury ; yet , by degrees , he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command . Andrew Fletcher , Political Works , pp . 35 and 221 ( 1749 ) . The right of self-defense is the first law of nature ; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits ... and [ when ] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is , under any color or pretext whatsoever , prohibited , liberty , if not already annihilated , is on the brink of destruction . Sir George Tucker , Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia , in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES , Sir George Tucker Ed. , 1803 , pg . 300 There are many solid legal , moral , and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership . Some are short , but many are long . I know quite a few of them , and I\u00c2 \u2019 ll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate . Just let me know here . -- - False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience ; that would take fire from men because it burns , and water because one may drown in it ; that has no remedy for evils , except destruction . The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature . They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity , the most important of the code , will respect the less important and arbitrary ones , which can be violated with ease and impunity , and which , if strictly obeyed , would put and end to personal liberty -- so dear to men , so dear to the enlightened legislator -- and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer ? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes , produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts , and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree . Thomas Jefferson , Commonplace Book , 1774-1776 , quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment , 1764 A militia , when properly formed , are in fact the people themselves , and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary . . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But , say gentlemen , the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns , can not well be called out , or be depended upon ; that we must have a select militia. . . . [ of the select militia ] These Corps , not much unlike regular troops , well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas , to preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms , and be taught alike , especially when young , how to use them . . . .The mind that aims at a select militia , must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle ; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it , whenever they can prevail , no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it . Richard Henry Lee , Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer , p. 169-170 ( 1788 ) Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India , history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest . If we want the Arms Act to be repealed , if we want to learn the use of arms , here is a golden opportunity . If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial , distrust will disappear , and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn . Ghandi , 2 M. Gandhi , An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth , p. 374 ( M. Desai , trans . 1927 ) . Whenever , therefore , the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated . . . .No free government was ever founded , or ever preserved its liberty , without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state . . . .Such a well regulated militia , composed of freeholders , citizens and husbandman , who take up arms to preserve their property , as individuals , and their rights as freemen . M. T. Cicero ( a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates ) , Charleston State Gazette , September 8 , 1788 It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government , that a well-regulated militia , composed of the yeomanry of the country , have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people . Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen . John DeWitt , The Anti-Federalist Papers , p. 75 ( M. Borden ed . 1965 ) Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms . V. I. Lenin , Collected Works , Vol . 35 , 4th ed. , p. 286 . From Congressional Record , April 28 , 1970 , p. H3601 . If the opposition disarms , well and good . If it refuses to disarm , we shall disarm it ourselves .

H3601 .. The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms . History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing . Indeed , I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty . So let 's not have any native militia or native police . German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories , and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country .

He got to the essential conclusions long before most of the tools of molecular biology were available . Think and experiment , use logic , do more experiments . He like Mendel managed to abstract what he was observing without being able to get down to the level of actual mechanisms .

{"id": "1647", "q": "Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned . Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city 's police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades . The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico 's drug wars . Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military-grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals . Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California . The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government 's 2-year-old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other . These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala . Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said . '' There is an arms race between the cartels , `` said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government . '' One group gets rocket-propelled grenades , the other has to have them. `` There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month . Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago . The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices . Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials . In a three-week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan . Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period . At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers . How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers . Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels . There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons . But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city 's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco . In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers ' pickup . The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile . The bodies of the officers were charred . '' These are really weapons of war , `` said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government . '' We only know these devices from war movies. `` U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago . The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years . The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers . Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico 's , and then were diverted onto the black market . Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say . The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan . Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more . Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala . The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia . Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high-caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel . Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade . Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey . The device at the consulate did not detonate . Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas . Three off-duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target . The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse . Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state . In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades . He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling . In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3-year-old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January . The firepower has gone beyond grenades . Armed with light antitank weapons , would-be assassins went after the nation 's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 . The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt . The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel . '' They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , `` Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time . ( He was killed in November in a plane crash . ) Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces . This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel . '' At this stage , the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces , `` a U.S. government official in Mexico said . '' Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color , `` the official said . '' It 's not your typical patrol stop , where someone pulls a gun . This has all the makings of an infantry squad , or guerrilla fighting. `` The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango . On Valentine 's Day , about 20 masked gunmen , led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains , stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co. , an industrial explosives manufacturer , according to official accounts . They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse . Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area . Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite , the incident augurs an even bloodier trend , officials said . '' There is only one reason to have bulk explosives , `` said Thomas G. Mangan , spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . '' An improvised explosive device . A car bomb. `` In addition to grenades , high-powered guns such as the .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers ' arsenals , Mangan said . Unlike grenades and antitank weapons , the .50-caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico , like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols . Mexican law enforcement , such as the police in Zihuatanejo , is grossly outgunned . Officers have protested , seeking better protective gear , weaponry and pay . Shortly after the Zihuatanejo attacks , police officers staged a brief work stoppage outside their headquarters , where scars from the grenade attack were still visible . One of the blasts left a cereal bowl-shaped divot in the stone pavement and pockmarks on the front of the police building . It went off 100 feet from the nearest street , prompting some officers to suspect that the assailants employed a grenade launcher . Police have piled sandbags 4 feet high around the compound and security is tight . Commanders have bought 10 bulletproof vests , but say they need at least 280 to equip the city 's 343 officers . The police commander , Pablo Rodriguez , said his officers are terrified . They are armed with semiautomatic .223-caliber rifles made in Italy , Germany and Mexico . The rifles , with folding stocks , are snazzy , but they are no match for the weapons being stockpiled by the drug cartels . '' They are good weapons , but to counteract the types of weapons they 're using against us , they 're not equal , `` Rodriguez said . His officers know they do n't stand a chance . Not five days after the highway attack that blew up the police truck , Rodriguez had jobs to fill . Twenty-two of his cops had abruptly quit .", "r": "So , the news is now out on how the Mexican drug cartels are smuggling in weaponry from Central America and across the sea , how they 're getting stuff that 's been left over from wars long fought , and even how they 're getting ahold of fully functional grenades , rocket launchers , and 40mm cannons .

Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago . Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004 , and they were all turned over to the police , Dr. McChesney said . The findings were released on Friday by the national conference , which has hired independent auditors to assess the church 's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002 . Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 . The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward , Dr. McChesney said .

So why did n't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so . When , eventually , during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said , `` Well , after all , faith is a gift from God ! `` , and I had received no such gift .

Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness ' and 'personhood , ' etc . come into play can there be valid debates . Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization , and I 'll show you a semantics game . It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life ' begins with recordable brain activity ( as early as 40-days post-conception ) ... or 'self-awareness ' or any other such concept , or when the entity would be 'viable ' outside the womb . But there are varying levels of brain activity . There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness . And viability is an ever-changing concept ( a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota , and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news ) .

To reject this truth or to treat it as \u00c2 one theory among others\u00c2 is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among God\u00c2 \u2019 s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that God\u00c2 \u2019 s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth .", "r": "Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter ."}, {"q": "Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture .", "r": "Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter ."}, {"q": "virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth", "r": "signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , have endorsed this letter ."}], "spans": [{"q": [[1862, 1989]], "r": [[0, 95]]}, {"q": [[0, 1211], [1215, 1238], [1242, 1989]], "r": [[0, 95]]}, {"q": [[0, 143]], "r": [[0, 95]]}, {"q": [[151, 251], [989, 1062]], "r": [[12, 63], [69, 95]]}]}

Are you saying that you are n't up to it ? If you want I 'll start calling you names too . Is n't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma ? As for thinking outside the box , I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does . To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen . In fact , you make a name in science by challenging established dogma . Just think about the famous scientists . Besides , how can I speak to you on an equal level about science when you do n't seem to understand it very well . Anyone who demands proof has no idea what science is or how it works . Then shall we start with a discussion of the carina ? I was n't sure that you were familiar with the terms and it makes the discussion easier to use the correct terms . Without discussing these structures and comparing them to theropods and birds you really ca n't understand why it is so clearly a transitional . But if you do n't want the condescending tone , then you need to pay attention . Perhaps if I told you to follow with your finger as you read it would help . If you can call me a pompous XXX the it should be OK if I call you ignorant , is n't it ? Why else would you be asking me at the end of your post I claimed exactly the opposite of what I actually claimed . I 'll explain at the risk of hurting your feelings again . Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed . They are reproductively isolated . They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species . So Herring gulls do n't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west , which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull ( which do n't reproduce with Herring gulls ) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population . They illustrate one way that species develop . There are other examples of ring species , the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau . So how about this ? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world . Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know . Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears , the have distinctive differences in their DNA . It is closer to Polar bear DNA , even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears . But guess what . All these bears can interbreed , including Polar bears with Grizzly bears . OK . Your turn for a few insults .

They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives . Instead , they killed 18 women and children . One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar . They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many `` sensitive operations `` going on in that region . Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in . The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi . He was born and raised in the tribal areas . He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . You ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem . Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia , six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms . They became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day . Most of the work is done by hand . The vendors are Pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world . They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s . These days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban . They purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army . This summer , I went back to Pakistan , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter . The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda . The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan . Meanwhile , Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations . But at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere . The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government .

{"id": "5448", "q": "Honestly Duck would you base your views off a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope . The bible is pretty much silent on abortion ( if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath ) , and the current pope 's record is hardly without blemishes . Why could n't this be a little different that the official line ?", "r": "To step in for Duck , Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope ? We would n't . The whole point is that he is the pope . We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals . ( By the way he 's 84 years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly . ) So we do n't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson 's . We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church . But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion : Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation . The unborn being is considered a child . Thus the commandment , `` Thou shalt not kill `` applies . Check out some of these verses as a start : Exodus 21:22-25 , Psalm 139:13-16 , Psalm 71:6 , Deutoronomy 30:19 , Luke 1:15 and 1:41 , Isaiah 49:1 , Jeremiah1:5 , 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 It is also of note that it was , in a sense , a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community . Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5 , Matthew 18:10 ( there are many other indications of this as well ) . An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset . The early Church also spoke out against abortion . Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject : http : //www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture . In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity ( including scripture ) , there are some essentials that must be noticed . The Bible unequivocally `` tells `` us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message . It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels . The Christian story is about birth , creation , joy , and perseverance . It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life . Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ . Abortion supporters say , `` This is my body , I can do with it what I want . I can destroy others to preserve my life . I can destroy others so that I may live as I want . Do not interfere with me. `` Whereas , Christ says , `` This is my body , which is given up for you. `` '' This is my body `` -- same words but much different in intent , in action , in charity , in love , in faith , in hope ... Jesus gives his body away so that others live . Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die .", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "bible silent on abortion", "r": "Bible `` tells `` us that abortion is wrong"}, {"q": "The bible is pretty much silent on abortion , and the current pope 's record is hardly without blemishes", "r": "To step in for Duck , Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope ?

When the final draft was presented , it was rejected and replaced by a version that had been put together by a YEC ( a geocentrist no less ) from Missouri .

The standards very clearly touted YEC ideas , barely mentioned even macro-evolution , and removed all references to the age of the earth and the universe . I know that sounds stupid , but then I do n't live in Kansas where school board members think that limiting mention of evolution to microevolution is smart . I read the proposed standards and the ones that were adopted . At the next election several creationists lost their seats , and the new school board threw out the `` new standards `` and adopted the version that had been written by the committee . Those standards probably actually did raise the levels of what was expected to be taught in Kansas schools from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best . You were aware that the Ford Foundation had funded a study of state science standards and Kansas had received an F. The creationist standards also received an F , and the standards written by the committee of scientists and educators received an A . You know , it almost would have been fun to be a biology teacher in Kansas when micro-evolution was OK and presentation of `` holes `` in the theory were required . I could have probably gone on for a week or two about the problems presented to the Biblical flood story from a biological standpoint . Noah 's flood requires macro-evolution .

Why do n't you try disputing facts than making up stories and childishly trying to copy me . Here lets start with this .... Please read and explain to me how ( if ) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr . Civil-Rights violator : 1 . Banning guns works , which is why New York , DC , & amp ; Chicago cops need guns . 2 . Washington DC 's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control , and Indianapolis ' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control . 3 . Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are `` just statistics. `` 4 . The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban , both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates , which have been declining since 1991 . 5 . We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid . 6 . The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals . 7 . An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray , but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you . 8 . A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet . 9 . When confronted by violent criminals , you should `` put up no defense -- give them what they want , or run `` ( Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields , Guns Do n't Die - People Do , 1981 , p.125 ) . 10 . The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns ; just like Guns & amp ; Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery . 11 . One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts , a civil engineer for a better bridge , a surgeon for internal medicine , a computer programmer for hard drive problems , and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise . 12 . The 2nd Amendment , ratified in 1787 , refers to the National Guard , which was created 130 years later , in 1917 . 13 . The National Guard , federally funded , with bases on federal land , using federally-owned weapons , vehicles , buildings and uniforms , punishing trespassers under federal law , is a `` state `` militia . 14 . These phrases : `` right of the people peaceably to assemble , `` `` right of the people to be secure in their homes , `` `` enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people , `` and `` The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively , and to the people `` all refer to individuals , but `` the right of the people to keep and bear arm `` refers to the state . 15 . '' The Constitution is strong and will never change. `` But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd , 4th , and 5th Amendments to that Constitution . 16 . Rifles and handguns are n't necessary to national defense ! Of course , the army has hundreds of thousands of them . 17 . Private citizens should n't have handguns , because they are n't `` military weapons `` , but private citizens should n't have `` assault rifles `` , because they are military weapons . 18 . In spite of waiting periods , background checks , finger printing , government forms , etc. , guns today are too readily available , which is responsible for recent school shootings . In the 1940 's , 1950 's and1960 's , anyone could buy guns at hardware stores , army surplus stores , gas stations , variety stores , Sears mail order , no waiting , no background check , no fingerprints , no government forms and there were no school shootings . 19 . The NRA 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda , but the anti-gun lobby 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign is responsible social activity . 20 . Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly , and so simple to use that they make murder easy . 21 . A handgun , with up to 4 controls , is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use , as opposed to an automobile that only has 20 . 22 . Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is `` an accident waiting to happen `` and gun makers ' advertisements aimed at women are `` preying on their fears. `` 23 . Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed . 24 . Guns cause violence , which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows . 25 . A majority of the population supports gun control , just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves . 26 . Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a `` weapon of mass destruction `` or an `` assault weapon. `` 27 . Most people ca n't be trusted , so we should have laws against guns , which most people will abide by because they can be trusted . 28 . The right of Internet pornographers to exist can not be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights , but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights . 29 . Free speech entitles one to own newspapers , transmitters , computers , and typewriters , but self-defense only justifies bare hands . 30 . The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution , and the NRA is bad , because it defends other parts of the Constitution . 31 . Charlton Heston , a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored , but Michael Douglas , a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control , Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit . 32 . Police operate with backup within groups , which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do `` civilians `` who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition . 33 . We should ban `` Saturday Night Specials `` and other inexpensive guns because it 's not fair that poor people have access to guns too . 34 . Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain . 35 . Private citizens do n't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection . 36 . Citizens do n't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs , who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops , need a gun . 37 . '' Assault weapons `` have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people . The police need assault weapons . You do not . 38 . When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion , that 's bad ; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & amp ; Wesson , that 's good . 39 . Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes , which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon . 40 .

{"id": "1585", "q": "Okay . Most botanist are evolutionist but facts are often confusing to evolutionist . You do n't seem to grasp the concept of the hostile witness . Of course he is an evolutionist , they both are , if Ken Ham said that it would not mean much . What they are both saying is that the people who promote the dinosaurs to birds scenario are lying propagandist , not scientist . Just so you ca n't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen 's letter in it 's entirety . National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , D. C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO : Dr. Peter Raven , Secretary PRaven @ nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington , DC 20036 Dear Peter , I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society . With the publication of `` Feathers for T. rex ? `` by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name `` the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , `` the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China. `` In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing `` in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes `` the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals `` is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers `` is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken . But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode .

A canyon of the same type was formed when Mt . St. Helens erupted when the snow and ice melted at the top and rushed down the slope . Even evolutionists have admitted that it looks just like the Grand Canyon , only on a smaller scale , and that it appears to have been created over millions of years but in fact it only took a couple of hours . For you to say that there isnt any evidence is a very ignorant thing because there is just as much evidence or more supporting the flood as there are people and things that dont support it . To answer the second question ... not all bones are fossilized . Bones do decompose . Also perhaps people just havent been looking in the right places .

{"id": "5925", "q": "Licensing systems are very expensive to administer . Canada 's experience with its full licensing and registration system , begun in December 1998 , is not encouraging . The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada 's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $ 185 million [ Canadian ] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $ 85 million [ Canadian ] . But , by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $ 327 million [ Canadian ] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government 's original forecast . The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country 's earlier gun control system , only 142,000 new licenses had been issued . Using these figures as a baseline for America 's arsenal of 65 million handguns , the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering . Most importantly , licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence , such as unintentional gunshot deaths , suicides and the majority of homicides , since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally . From a political perspective , a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray . The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners . In contrast , health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers . Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration : we register automobiles and license drivers , so why not guns ? However , licensing and registration\u00c2\u2014the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation\u00c2\u2014had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury .
