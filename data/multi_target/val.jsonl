{"id": "7800", "q": "How did a lizard evolve an avian lung ?", "r": "Well , the easy answer is that a lizard did n't evolve an avian lung . There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung . However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians . And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds , having arisen from an ancestral archosaur . The dinosaurs , through the ornithodirans , also arose from archosaurs . So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs . So some birds have a system of ( usually ) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs . Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration , they do have other functions , such as thermoregulation and weight reduction . Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds . However , there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first . Thus , in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight . But some birds , current and fossil , do not have pneumatic bones . For example , Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons . But of course , Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight . Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say . To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself .", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "How did a lizard evolve an avian lung", "r": "There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians ."}, {"q": "How did a lizard evolve an avian lung ?", "r": "Well , the easy answer is that a lizard did n't evolve an avian lung ."}], "spans": [{"q": [[0, 36]], "r": [[71, 130], [134, 358]]}, {"q": [[0, 38]], "r": [[0, 69]]}]}

{"id": "546", "q": "O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesn\u00c2 \u2019 t have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . But lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance . I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America\u00c2 \u2019 s armies for one simple reason . The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg ( I know my spelling sucks ) like attack . Most of the ICBM silos are n't connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . Now , you may be wondering what am I trying to say here . Well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated , it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy 's capital city to make attack impossible . Again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? Even if that worked the U.S. , like Russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked . But lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , REALLY cool party some XXXXX colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know , that\u00c2 \u2019 s a pretty low number for the invasion of America ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles ( again lets assume somehow America\u00c2 \u2019 s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America\u00c2 \u2019 s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . The hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2 . Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3. all groups preparing for `` battle `` so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 . It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y. , N.Y. , and .... wait America\u00c2 \u2019 s satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would n't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit ( effectively sitting ducks ) . And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- But militia units only have guns , and they would get their butts whooped , even with massive numbers . What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics , in today\u00c2 \u2019 s modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint , the terrain was different , the people are more hardened , the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians , the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves , had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide , plan and attack , only had to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross , the Russians were under funded and their moral low , the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire , china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence , Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces , the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S. , it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America , and , finally , the afgans did n't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands , but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan , the americans would be defended their homeland . Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point , as I have said , your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power ? ( in case you did n't learn it in school , Napoleon the 3rd , napoleon 's nephew , was in power during the french revolution ) Trust me , cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare . -- -- As I have shown in more detail , Treat2 is right , it would n't work. -- -- -- The other amendments do n't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A , they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and `` In Fashion `` so long as the U.S. still has human citizens .

Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible \u00c2\u2013 the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark \u00c2\u2013 convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as \u00c2 \u201c one theory among others\u00c2 \u201d is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among God\u00c2 \u2019 s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that God\u00c2 \u2019 s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge .

First , you must realize that evolution is still a theory . Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution . We have the laws of physics , the laws of chemistry , the laws of mathematics , the laws of thermodynamics . These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology . They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone . They are the Laws of the Universe . For evolution to become a law , it must fall in line with the other laws . There can be no contradictions . The truth must be the truth . The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase . Entropy is the tendency toward chaos . Increasing entropy means increasing chaos . The universe is winding down on an irreversible path . Every process that takes place in nature , whether mechanical , electrical , chemical , or biological is winding down , becoming more chaotic . All processes will finally cease , and the Universe will stop . That is a scientific fact . If the Universe is running down , becoming more chaotic all the time , how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly , more organized , more complex . Scientists say , that random encounters of atoms , molecules , joining and splitting , eventually create order . I 'm sorry , that 's in direct contradiction to the Second Law . It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years , especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes . Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy : there is a huge difference between living and non-living things . There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba . The goo is total chaos . The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature . The odds of random mixing by weather , earthquake , etc . that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion . It 's not going to happen . Thirdly , look at DNA . Scientists are mapping the human genome , the very basis of life itself . What are they finding ? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being . Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher . And every bit of the human body carries DNA . Theorically , it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human . How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature ? Fourth , how do you explain human consciousness ? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world , but also be aware of himself as a unique person ?

{"id": "8586", "q": "Gun registry has been a failure", "r": "THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION by Alan Korwin Dear Editor , Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns , so here it is . How exactly would writing down my name , or your name , help arrest criminals or make you safer ? Although at first blush , gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal , on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all . The unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime . 1 . Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive . Do you know what it takes to run a database that big ? You need 19,000 changes daily , just to keep up with people who move every ten years . Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs , payroll , parking and dry cleaning bills . It 's a government jobs program all by itself , all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime . How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done ? That 's right , none , and the planners know that . All that money and time , invested on tracking the innocent . That 's why so many police departments are against it -- they 'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources , and hire clerks instead of cops . 2 . Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime . Under registration , activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon . Think about that . Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest , if the property is n't on the government 's master list . Boy , that does n't sound like the American way . No other evil is needed , there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place . Paperwork equals prison . That 's just wrong . 3 . Registration , if enacted , will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade . How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants , before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties ? People get what they want either way , it 's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it . With respect to guns , the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy , for gun runners . 4 . People have said to me , `` But Alan , if all guns were registered and there was a crime , then you could tell. `` Tell what ? If your neighbor is shot , that 's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius . The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive , opportunity , witnesses , physical evidence , the murder weapon . Police are n't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers . Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component . 5 . You do n't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people , do you ? Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York , California and Louisiana , and global history for the past century , this could n't really happen , do you think ? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America , with its Bill of Rights ? The guarantees against confiscating property , unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power . Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures ? ( Unfortunately , it 's a long list of usual suspects . ) And what about the so-called First Amendment test ? If it 's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too . Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers ? Why indeed . Pile logic on logic , some people just feel the government should register everything , just to keep control . When government has that much control , you no longer possess your liberties . You 're living where government lists define who can do what , and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely . This form of `` gun control `` is n't about guns , it 's about control . I might favor registration if the system would include criminals . In fact , I 'd favor testing the system on them first . But the U.S. Supreme Court , in a widely known case ( Haynes v. U.S. , 1968 ) , had determined that a felon who has a gun can not be compelled to complete such forms , because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination . That 's right , mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime , and is therefore prohibited . * Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the `` news `` media , engorges the federal or state bureaucracy , and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms . It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words , and should be rejected outright . Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve , protect and defend , and deserve to be removed from office . Sincerely , Alan Korwin , Author Gun Laws of America * NOTE : This case only concerned a limited class of weapons , `` destructive devices , `` which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act . Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor , and not the transferee , of such devices to file papers , and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem . In U.S. v. Freed , 1971 , the Court agreed the problem had been fixed ( for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case ) . A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem . A prohibited possessor can not have a firearm at all , so mere possession is a serious crime . An additional charge for failing to register the gun that ca n't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case . However , possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon , with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure . The innocent would have to register to remain legal , the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself .", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "Gun registry has been a failure", "r": "has a no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . been Gun registry failure"}, {"q": "Gun registry has been a failure", "r": "How exactly would writing down my name , or your name , help arrest criminals or make you safer ?"}, {"q": "Gun registry has been a failure", "r": "Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns , so here it is .

I have heard that babies do not have a recognition of self - in the sense that , though they have personal experiences of pain , sensation , etc , they do not recognize themselves as separate from others - they just do n't think about their separateness so there is no recognition of a separate `` I `` . Similarly , most animals may have a sense of self - they may have a central mental center which feels the sensations , experiences the emotions , etc . - but many do not necessarily have a recognition of themselves as an `` I `` and others as `` you `` . They just do n't think about the separateness - they just have experiences that they react to .

They would have been `` eliminated `` because heterosexuality is far superior . Think again . The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission ( bacteria dividing ) , asexual reproduction ( there goes your `` individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . None of these things require sexes of any type . Even animals that have `` normal `` sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis , in which only a female is required to produce offspring ( turkeys and lizards do this ) . If homosexuality is n't natural or is inferior , then why do we see examples of it in nature . The bonobo ( closely related to the chimpanzee ) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild , and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor .

You also ca n't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is `` natural `` is valid . Also , you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a `` greater purpose `` . By implying that something has a purpose , you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology . If you want to assume that things were given `` purpose `` by some higher being , that 's fine , but you 'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument . In science , it is impossible to assume a purpose . For example , what is the purpose of a river ? To flow to the ocean ? To carve a canyon ? To carry sediment ? You can say what something is good at doing , or what it does , but you can not say what it was `` made `` for ( purpose ) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion .

I presume that the rest of the `` scientists `` listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed . I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list , now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life . The name `` Steve `` ( and variations thereof ) comprises about 1 % of the population . The percentage of qualified scientists with that name can not be far from the norm . The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology , geology , paleontology , or a related scientific field . However , there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory . For example , Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list . I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list . I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts . Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees . Oh , yes . In my experience , creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists . On the other hand , there are lots of scientists who were once creationists , before they became scientists . As many polls have shown , the more educated a person becomes , the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist .", "s": "AGREE", "primes": [{"q": "It 's not a difficult challange .", "r": "No , it was n't . `` ''"}, {"q": "It 's not a difficult challange .", "r": "No , it was n't .

{"id": "152", "q": "This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong . ToE is constructed on a fraud premise . This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene . Whenever an evolutionist talks about \u00c2 \u201c evolution\u00c2 \u201d he\u00c2 \u2019 s not talking about mere phenotypic change \u00c2\u2013 he\u00c2 \u2019 s talking about changes in genes . To a Darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that \u00c2 \u201c evolution\u00c2 \u201d has occurred . A fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered `` evolution. `` The only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . This premise , I suggest is a complete and total fraud ... and I will explain why now : Let\u00c2 \u2019 s take humans and dogs , for example . When compared side-by-side , sure enough , humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not \u00c2\u2013 and possibly the other way around . But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs do n't , does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs . Of course , there are no \u00c2 \u201c dog genes\u00c2 \u201d or \u00c2 \u201c human genes.\u00c2 \u201d But likewise there are no \u00c2 \u201c tongue genes , \u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c tail genes\u00c2 \u201d or \u00c2 \u201c toenail genes.\u00c2 \u201d Parts are not translated genes . Thus , the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible . But it 's worse than that . As I said before , humans have a whole slew of genes \u00c2\u2013 theoretically , at least -- that dogs ( or other animals ) don\u00c2 \u2019 t have . But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms ! That\u00c2 \u2019 s why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny ! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are ? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have ... But they\u00c2 \u2019 ve got it backwards ! Instead , we have the genes we have because of who we are . A dog is n't a dog because he barks ; a dog barks because of what he is . Same with genes . This , of course , spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud . Evolution , thus , should not be a theory based on changes in genes , but a theory based on changes in traits . But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them . They simply won\u00c2 \u2019 t give up because they\u00c2 \u2019 ve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses . But here\u00c2 \u2019 s where they\u00c2 \u2019 re screwing everything up : When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head ? If so , did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time ? If so , do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head ? Or , do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red ? That\u00c2 \u2019 s excactly what science is doing with genetics : they\u00c2 \u2019 ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes ( the red face ) is causing the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) In reality , what\u00c2 \u2019 s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment ( turning upside down ) and then the genes are responding in kind ( turning red ) . The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things : 1 ) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures . 2 ) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over .

{"id": "5942", "q": "Well it seems we have a contradiction , now does n't it .... Michael Ruse : The most dramatic discoveries in evo-devo have been quite unexpected DNA homologies .

The jury is still out on the precise significance of all of this . Some seem to think that selection will now have to take a back seat in evolution : `` The homologies of process within morphogenetic fields provide some of the best evidence for evolution just as skeletal and organ homologies did earlier . Thus , the evidence for evolution is better than ever . The role of natural selection in evolution , however , is seen to play less an important role .

'' It is an abomination in the eyes of Me. `` Witnesses said the attack , which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring , 51 , and clinic nurse Danielle Costa , 29 , came from `` out of nowhere. `` '' He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring , `` receptionist Iris Reid said . '' The next thing I knew , He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving. `` '' It was horrible , `` said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs , recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen . '' He put his hands over Dr. Woodring 's head and told him He forgave him for his sins , and then He shot him right in the face. `` Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room , where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe . Federal investigators are similarly baffled , saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in `` mysterious ways. `` Speaking to reporters from His holding cell , Christ , 33 , said He had `` no regrets `` about what He had done . '' As I said in John 16:21 , every life is precious , `` Christ said . '' This means every life , not just those who have already been born . My father , the Lord , feels the same way I do . In Jeremiah 1:5 , He said unto the prophet Jeremiah , 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , before you were born I set you apart . ' The unborn fetus is a sacred , living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such. `` Added Christ : `` What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me ? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so . After all , it was n't even her decision to conceive me in the first place . But in the end , she made the right decision , bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior . Blessed is she among women. `` According to legal experts , if convicted , Christ could face the death penalty .", "r": "Christ Kills Two , Injures Seven In Abortion-Clinic Attack | The Onion - America 's Finest News Source Disclaimer : It 's THE ONION ( as if most would n't figure that out on their own ... )", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "Jesus Christ , son of God and noted pro-life activist , killed two and critically wounded seven others", "r": "Christ Kills Two , Injures Seven In Abortion-Clinic Attack | The Onion -"}, {"q": "Jesus Christ killed two wounded seven others fire abortion clinic Witnesses said", "r": "Christ Kills Two , Injures Seven In Abortion-Clinic Attack The Onion ..."}, {"q": "Jesus Christ , son of God and noted pro-life activist , killed two and critically wounded seven others", "r": "Christ Kills Two , Injures Seven In Abortion-Clinic Attack"}, {"q": "Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday .

{"id": "5356", "q": "I do n't believe it is DrNo , because by its very definition evolution claims that Man evolved from the lower animals . It relegates us to nothing more than a biological organism with no more value than an viral bacteria . Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace . Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross . Also , you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity . That 's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand . Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation . One must not compromise what the bible says in order to find a happy medium with the worlds philosophies . That is folly and will only lead to confusion . What you should ask yourself is why are beasts which can only be described as dinosaurs be found mentioned in the bible ? How did Ancient , so called stone aged men describe living creatures at the time , in their world which evolutionists will tell you were extinct for at least 60 million years by then , only 6,000 to 10,000 years ago ? Here 's what I mean . Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24 It \u00c2 \u201c eats grass like an ox.\u00c2 \u201d It \u00c2 \u201c moves his tail like a cedar.\u00c2 \u201d ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , \u00c2 \u201c he lets hang his tail like a cedar.\u00c2 \u201d ) Its \u00c2 \u201c bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c He is the first of the ways of God.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh.\u00c2 \u201d Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! 17 His tail [ b ] sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . 19 He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword . 20 The hills bring him their produce , and all the wild animals play nearby . 21 Under the lotus plants he lies , hidden among the reeds in the marsh . 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow ; the poplars by the stream surround him . 23 When the river rages , he is not alarmed ; he is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth . 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes , [ c ] or trap him and pierce his nose ? Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41 , Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 . This is only a partial listing\u00c2\u2014just enough to make the point . \u00c2 \u201c No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ? \u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c His rows of scales are his pride , shut up tightly as with a seal ; one is so near another that no air can come between them ; they are joined one to another , they stick together and can not be parted.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c His sneezings flash forth light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lights ; sparks of fire shoot out . Smoke goes out of his nostrils , as from a boiling pot and burning rushes . His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear.\u00c2 \u201d Leviathan \u00c2 \u201c played\u00c2 \u201d in the \u00c2 \u201c great and wide sea\u00c2 \u201d ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26\u00c2\u2014get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . Leviathan is a \u00c2 \u201c reptile [ a ] that is in the sea.\u00c2 \u201d ( Isaiah 27:1 ) [ a ] Note : The word translated \u00c2 \u201c reptile\u00c2 \u201d here is the Hebrew word tanniyn . This shows that \u00c2 \u201c Leviathan\u00c2 \u201d was also a \u00c2 \u201c tanniyn\u00c2 \u201d ( dragon ) . Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth . Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea . How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years ? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe , then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? And while your at it , ask yourself if it 's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust ? Does that make rational sense to you ? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs . They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus . Yet bones/fossils buried in the Earth with the upheavals , alkalis and acids in the earth in addition to the weather have survived over 60 million years ?

Riding a dead horse indeed ! http : //opinionjournal.com/columnist ... l/ ? id=110004653 Bellesiles Misfires An antigun `` scholar `` as today 's Galileo ? Oh please , just shoot me . BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL Friday , February 6 , 2004 12:01 a.m. EST History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses , men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it . There 's the hemlocked Socrates , the house-arrested Galileo , the exiled Rousseau . And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles . Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book `` Arming America. `` An academic bombshell , the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns . This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America `` but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , `` is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes. `` As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity. `` And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth. `` One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian. `` In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change . If it were , we 'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth . Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity . But before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof . Mr. Bellesiles 's problem is n't that he 's misunderstood ; it 's that he still has n't given them any . Or as the old saying goes : `` To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right. `` Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal .", "s": "DISAGREE", "primes": [{"q": "So then you believe the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right ?", "r": "right To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be"}, {"q": "then you believe the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right ?", "r": "And you never answered and just moved on with your confusing , conflicting facts and positions . what then is your position"}, {"q": "the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right", "r": "He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government"}, {"q": "then you believe the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right ?", "r": "Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past ."}, {"q": "So then you believe the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right", "r": "To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right. `` Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal ."}], "spans": [{"q": [[0, 69]], "r": [[320, 324], [5154, 5237]]}, {"q": [[3, 69]], "r": [[0, 122]]}, {"q": [[20, 67]], "r": [[2696, 2816]]}, {"q": [[3, 69]], "r": [[4328, 4471]]}, {"q": [[0, 67]], "r": [[5154, 5324]]}]}

'' Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong ``", "r": "Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt .

If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy `` then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal `` in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad .... it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant `` so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it . Too bad .... it 's true . You do n't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day . One day , He will be finished with you as well . Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this ( God is speaking ) : All these things you have done and I kept silent . You thought I was altogether like you , but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces . Ps 50:21 Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy ? ' God changed His mind !

{"id": "2772", "q": "i think its finally settled that physical ( testable or tangible ) evidence of God can never be found . this is not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirements . from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law . that is , physical laws are constant and unbreakable , and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them . because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe , there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do , at least where the phsical realm is concerned . there is no supernatural phenomenon , and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect from a religious perspective , knowledge of God can only come through faith . we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence , in other word believing without evidence . Hebrews 11:6 says `` And without faith it is impossible to please him . For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. `` faith is the key to religion , and only through faith can religion be established . therefore , if some physical observation could verify God 's existence , then it would contradict what religion says about God . this is a real catch 22. you search for evidence to solidify your faith , but if evidence comes you dont need faith , and without faith you can not relate to God in all , as far as i 'm concrned , it is totally futile to seek rational proof of God 's existence . even if it was found , it wouldnt be found . i remember saying that it is possible to prove that God exists ; that is , in the event that God showed up and said `` hey , it 's Me ! '' . but even this can never happen , because such a scenario would contradict the bible , and thus not prove God exists as far as the bible is concerned . and when all is said and done , it still doesnt answer the question `` does God exist ? ``", "r": "But then it also does n't answer the question `` does anything exist `` , nor does it answer an infinite number of `` existence `` questions . Do `` trolls `` exist , follows the same reasoning . If you find one , they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature , they are some organic life form that can be measured , tested , and quantified .. i.e . no longer an imaginary creature . So they can no more be found than god . So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you 'll see why the question `` Does god exist ? '' , has no real importance in the physical universe . ( does the tooth fairy exist , does a unicorn exist , do flying pigs exist , etc . ) In fact , I like that statement . The existence of god is not imporant ... Rather - the FAITH in god ( s , etc . ) is what is `` important `` , and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact . I think that 's why I do n't mind so much `` religion `` per se , it 's the human condition that brings suffering , and uncertainty , into our lives and for some people , the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition . ( the human condition also brings joy , love , etc. , but I 'd like that without the pain personally ) I only mind it when things in the physical universe are `` attacked `` with the premise of belief in god ( s ) , which is a waste of human energy ... we have a limited time , do n't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge . And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions . ... she 's a witch because she MADE the crops die ... she must be burned . ... he broke `` god 's `` law and therefore must be guilty .. ... this is `` god 's `` war .. Yeah , that still scares me . That 's why I think , at least in the US , the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important , and accepted . While there are fundamentalists that rail against it ... it 's hopefully obvious that with ~80 % of the US believing in an imaginary `` god `` , but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world , then the two can obviously co-exist , and I 'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed .

Samples that are dated by radiometric dating methods are dated by more than one method before a date is reached . For a sample to be dated by 2 different isotopes and both isotopes are flawed yet give the same date range is simply impossible . Carbon dating ( which is only good for about 50,000 years ) is checked against ice core samples , dendochronology , lake varves , just to name a few other dating methods , and it is virtually always verified .

{"id": "5934", "q": "`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because \u00c2 \u201c most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.\u00c2 \u201d That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFE\u00c2 \u2019 s Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico\u00c2 \u2019 s problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified `` the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government\u00c2 \u2019 s failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end Mexico\u00c2 \u2019 s chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that Obama\u00c2 \u2019 s teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crew\u00c2 \u2019 s hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste. `` Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction . If it is more than that , if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp. ``", "r": "`` As President Calder\u00c3\u00b3n and I discussed , I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war , `` President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month . He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America . ( In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico 's government . ) '' We 're going to be very focused on this . It 's going to be a top priority. `` ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama `` felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a [ s ] it affects their safety.\u00c2 \u201d You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90 % figure , Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it . Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they do n't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico .

You are right about the people who would give uop their gun . It would be the law-abiding ones , but you are saying this as if they would do something immoral . Huh ? It was obvious that this stupid argument comes up again . Bosnia : People there occasionaly owned guns , but what could a few familiy fathers do when the army comes and shoots everyone . Not much . Oh ? You lived in Bosnia ? Hmm .. I 'm glad a coward like you was n't around when the British 'army ' came calling on the Colonists who were 'family fathers ' . Afghanistan : Do you really think that the Afghanis would have had the same chances against the Soviets without Stingers or CIA training showing them how to plan terrorist attacks ? Sure , without gun control the second-mightiest army would have never attacked Afghanistan ... The Afghans were causing all kinds of grief before we got involved . So , yeah , the Stingers , etc . were a help , but not the deciding factor . Warsaw : That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry . In the ghetto of Warsaw , there WAS an armed uprise . The result ? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge . And if they had more guns , maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes . Yeah , it 's stupid to defend yourself . Maybe they were n't as cowardly as yourself and did n't want to die on their knees like you would ? Oh , the Germans did shell and bomb the Ghetto as I recall . And here I thought you were an expert on European history ? Please don\u00c2\u00b4t you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3 . Reich . Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of Hitler\u00c2\u00b4s power or the way that WW2 went . I 'll bring up whatever I want to , XXXXX . So , cram it ! Once gun-control was established by the Nazis , how were his opponents suppose to overthrow him had they decided to ? Do like you , and put flowers in the barrels of the Storm Trooper 's Mausers ? Give peace a chance ? Yeah , that 'd work ! Also , nowhere in there did it say anything about the 'way WW2 went ' .. you 're just making stuff up .

{"id": "3086", "q": "It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage , even if only indirectly . Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation . The belief that the \u00c2 \u201c sanctity of marriage\u00c2 \u201d would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples , but better identifies the source of the opposition . Whether expressly or impliedly , much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere , deeply ingrained\u00c2\u2014 even fundamental\u00c2\u2014religious belief . Yet , such views are not the only religious views of marriage . As demonstrated by amicus groups , other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31 This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa\u00c2 \u2019 s same-sex marriage ban . Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them . See Iowa Const . art . I , \u00c2\u00a7 3 ( \u00c2 \u201c The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .\u00c2 \u201d ) . The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions . Instead , the statute declares , \u00c2 \u201c Marriage is a civil contract\u00c2 \u201d and then regulates that civil contract . Iowa Code \u00c2\u00a7 595A.1 . Thus , in pursuing our task in this case , we proceed as civil judges , far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics , and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage . _____ 31 Many religions recognize same-sex marriage , such as Buddhists , Quakers , Unitarians , and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews . Schuman , 96 Geo . L.J . at 2108 . Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders , Communities , and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages , but does not require , its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual , gay , and lesbian couples , while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care .

The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years . The Court found that the film was misleading : over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years . 3 . The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming . The Government\u00c2 \u2019 s expert had to accept that it was \u00c2 \u201c not possible\u00c2 \u201d to attribute one-off events to global warming . 4 . The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming . The Government\u00c2 \u2019 s expert had to accept that this was not the case . 5 . The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice . It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study : in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm . 6 . The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age : the Claimant\u00c2 \u2019 s evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility . 7 . The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching . The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim . 8 . The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously . The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia . 9 . The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting , the evidence was that it is in fact increasing . 10 . The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people . In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration . 11 . The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand .

{"id": "3748", "q": "Can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally ( without going through selection ) validates darwinism , which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted ?", "r": "Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful . HGT ( along with genetic drift ) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory , but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto , which does indeed insist on natural selection . This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us , and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM & amp ; NS alone , and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory . HGT validates the modern ToE . Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin 's version , and lot 's more . HGT is part of the `` lots more `` . Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades , notably versions of conjugation in bacteria . ( It was n't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth . ) When someone like Gould ( for example ) talks about Darwinian evolution , depending on context , they are talking about either 1 ) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it , 2 ) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution , or 3 ) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process . Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin 's initial ideas to include mutations , recombination , and genetic drift , including HGT , in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection .

So , lacking any real material with which to attack his actual work , the anti gunners are essentially stepping back and calling him a `` dummy head `` . In todays modern political/academic environment , what higher form of flattery can there possibly be than charachter assasination ? It is what they fall back on when they find your argument to be irrefutable . The NAS study was supposed to be `` their study `` .

It is over , there is really no point to debating it anymore . We have seen the most scritinized review of the available data EVER , and the antigunners have had the wind knocked out of their sails .

Children should not be allowed to go online and find their half-siblings or biological fathers without parental consent . Children in this position are not capable of making a decision of this magnitude . Their parents have their best interests at heart and should have control over the situation . It could be emotionally damaging to meet a half-sibling or a biological father if they are not ready , and only their parents know for sure . Parents are the people who raise and love their kids , not the people who give birth or donate sperm . Stephanie Singer -- Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , Nov. 21 , 2005 To the Editor : I am saddened that your Nov. 20 front-page article used the term `` father `` to refer to a sperm donor . '' Fathers `` are parents who raise children . They change diapers , go to soccer practice , supervise first dates . '' Fathers `` are members of a family , not anonymous sperm donors . There are millions of healthy parents raising children across our country . These parents may not be a traditional `` father `` and `` mother. `` They may be grandparents , single parents , gay parents , family friends , couples who adopt . How often will they be condemned for their absence of `` father `` ? When can we celebrate the reality of these successful , healthy , happy families without holding on to the false myth of the American family ? Alyson D. Miller -- Portland , Ore. , Nov. 20 , 2005 To the Editor : As your Nov. 20 front-page article points out , many sperm banks have not kept records of conceptions . But this is changing . Most sperm banks today not only keep records of conceptions and births , but also limit the number of families created by one donor . The article leaves the impression that all donor insemination offspring have little or no information about their donors and limited opportunity to connect with other donor families . In fact , since the early 1980 's , there has been a movement toward providing more information about donors to their offspring . The Sperm Bank of California pioneered a program in 1983 that allows adult offspring access to their donor 's identity . In 1997 , we started a family contact service to allow families who used the same donor to have contact with one another . In recent years , an increasing number of sperm banks have developed similar programs . The conventional wisdom is that most men would donate sperm only anonymously . But in the past two years , 75 percent of donors at our bank have chosen to participate in our identity program .

{"id": "5929", "q": "Creation : The belief that the universe ( and of course everything in it ) was created by some supernatural entity . To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something `` outside `` the knowable universe . Because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to `` believe `` in . You can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief . ================================================= The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth : Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws , which can be rationally explained . There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse , yet creation begins with an irrational premise , that we can `` know `` about the `` unknowable `` . It can certainly be a false theory , however , you can rationally show that it is or is not ( to the degree determined by your evidence ) . ================================================ You can not begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable . It is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution , unless you can somehow show that you are n't relying on the unknowable . I think many topcis in this forum are good debate topcis , philosophy , politics , health care , environment , entertainment , fun , etc . This topic , like a few other noteworthy topics , requires one side to abandon reason for faith , an irrational position , as premise . Keep in mind two important points : 1 . Reason does not imply truth , it 's a method of seperating truth from what is false , and you can quite easily ( and do every day ) , reason something to a false conclusion . There is nothing knowable that is beyond the reach of reason , this is why for someone to claim faith is somehow possible WITH reason , one has to try and show that reason is somehow insufficient for the acquisition of knowledge , which it is n't . ( see other thread Proof of God ) 2 . You can believe whatever you like , and it can certainly impact your life ( faith ) , however it can not be said that faith is based on rational belief , or takes part in reason , in any way , it is the opposite of reason . Reason requires evidence , faith does not , they can not be intermixed .

You may have to put up with it , as there may be some people who choose to do that , and you have no control to stop them . Just as a suggestion , you may get further by asking respectfully that people not comment unless they have read the entire article . My two cents . ) In this particular article , Mr. Alcorn does not back up any of his assertions with evidence . Some of what he states in this article is common knowledge that needs no documentation ( i.e . a human fetus is human and it is alive ) . But in this article , he states many generalities , he states many opinions ( to which there are alternate views ) , and he backs nothing up . I 'm not saying that the facts he presents can not be backed up , but until they are backed up with solid documentation , there are a lot of holes in what he is saying . For example : `` 2f . There is substantial scientific reason to believe frozen embryos are persons , and should be granted the same rights as older , larger and less vulnerable persons. `` Substantial scientific reason ? ? ? Like what ? A 'person ' is not a scientific concept . Science does not identify the definitions of what can or can not be labeled a 'person . ' That is a legal and/or philisophical topic . '' 3g . Even before the unborn is obviously human in appearance , she is what she is-a human being. `` Here again , a human being is not a scientific term . '' 3e . Every abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves. `` This is not necessarily true . Mr. Alcorn also asserts that the birth control pill causes abortions prior to implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining . There is no beating heart or measurable brain activity at this stage of biological development . Both of his assertions , as stated , can not be correct . If one statement is true , then the other must logically be false . '' 5d . It is a scientific fact that there are thought processes at work in unborn babies. `` Where 's the evidence ? Define 'thought processes . ' It may be a fact ... that leaves open the possibility that it may not be true . '' 5h . Arguments against the personhood of the unborn are shrouded in rationalization and denial. `` This is his opinion ... to which he is entitled . '' 9a . Once we grant that the unborn are human beings , it should settle the question of their right to live. `` True . But we have not yet granted that unborn are 'human beings . ' '' 13b . The poor choice of premarital sex is never compensated for by the far worse choice of killing an innocent human being. `` Again . This is merely Mr. Alcorn 's opinion -- both that premarital sex is a 'poor choice ' and the remainder of the statement . '' 14a . Early feminists were prolife , not prochoice. `` Define 'early . ' Are we talking back to the days of Eve ? I do n't believe Margaret Sanger was prolife . '' 14d . The basic premises of the abortion-rights movement are demeaning to women. `` Unsupported opinion . '' 17a . Every child is wanted by someone-there is no such thing as an unwanted child. `` How many children are on the street in this great country ? How many children are waiting to be adopted ? It may be true that all children are wanted by someone , but it is also true that there are many , many children without a home and without a family ... who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home , not finding anyone who 'wants ' them . This is fact . A dear friend of mine is a child protection social worker in a metropolitan area . She deals with this every day . '' 18c . If children are viewed as expendable before birth , they will be viewed as expendable after birth. `` Not sure if I follow this one ... if someone wants a child in the womb , they are not viewed as expendable before birth ... if someone does n't want a child in the womb and it is aborted , there wo n't be anything to be expendable after birth . '' 20b . The dramatic decline in our birth rate will have a disturbing economic effect on America. `` Ummm ... this may be true . It may not be true . Fact is ... we do n't know . We can only make educated guesses . I could go on ... but I think my point has been made . One final one , though ... I had to giggle when I read this one : `` Abortion has made us a nation of schizophrenics about our children. `` It seems that you are fervent in your beliefs that abortion is 'wrong . ' I respect you for knowing what you believe and for standing up for it . Understand , though , that there are individuals who may disagree with you . To imply that they are 'wrong ' and you are 'right ' or they are ignorant or stupid or anything of the sort is a rather self-centered view of the world .

Nor is it 'natural selection ' at work either , as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural . What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what ? Natural what ? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they 've learnt to hear . Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given ... `` Finally , Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e.g . K. Kato , et al. , ? A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2 ? , Microbiology ( Reading ) 141 ( 10 ) :2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] In fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . This suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria. `` '' All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein-degrading ) enzyme . This may seem surprising ? How would a loss of information create a new ability ? Answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . If this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . To put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . Indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme `` http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... e7-24-2000.asp Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk `` Whilst this particular case does not `` prove `` evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution. `` Why do they say this ? Because it 's still a bacteria . It 's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism . But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations . One site does say that it , the bacteria , had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ? mutations ? , but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus . http : //members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this ... `` In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain , which is n't the case with nylon eating bacteria . The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon , therefore was able to survive in a new environment . Two distinct advantages But , the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment , eat its former diet and suffered a 98 % loss in efficiency . Three disadvantages . So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward , where is the net gain ?

{"id": "6730", "q": "SS - your implication is that if Christians testify to the efficasy of prayer , then the result is God-derived . If not , why use the word prayer ? Across the human species , we can all use inner strength to fight e.g . illness : Christians and non-Christians alike will have varying degrees of success . That is certainly not evidence that if a Christian prays , that it was a Supreme Being causing a beneficial result . Correct . A human construct . What YOU want it to be , not what God wants it to be . That 's why there are so many flavours of religion . Your mind tells YOU what is convenient and plausible for YOU . And from there you argue that that is proof of the existence of God because you can feel it in mind , soul and body . Such is the folly of wanting and believing . Think outside the box .", "r": "So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick , that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs , but that is n't a miracle that can be attributed to God , but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ? So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name , when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake , happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes , are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true , then you must admit that something supernatural still happened , it 's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name . Now mind you , I totally reject that , as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking , that I have no supernatural powers within me . And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural , and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened . But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that can not be denied . And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend . Because you see , I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all , yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975 . And if you want to believe me , 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75 . So as it is written , before the foundation of the World , God Knew me . And while I was yet in the womb , He knew me . And while I was in the womb , He knew the number of hairs on my head . So also , even before I accepted Jesus and was born again , my Father in Heaven knew me , loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation . This is why I 'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief . If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had , I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have . I have prophesied , spoken in the language of the Angels , been supernaturally saved from drowning , been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time . But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money . That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind , `` Lord Jesus , help me `` . Nothing I did stopped the attack , nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes . I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy . And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me , then he said to me , the next time I 'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards .
